language models (LLMs) see increasing adoption across the globe, it is imperative for LLMs to be representative of the linguistic diversity of the world. India is a linguistically diverse country of 1.4 Billion people. To facilitate research on multilingual LLM evaluation, we release IndicGenBench - the largest benchmark for evaluating LLMs on user-facing generation tasks across a diverse set 29 of Indic languages covering 13 scripts and 4 language families. IndicGenBench is composed of diverse generation tasks like cross-lingual summarization, machine translation, and cross-lingual question answering. IndicGenBench extends existing benchmarks to many Indic languages through human curation providing multi-way parallel evaluation data for many under-represented Indic languages for the first time. We evaluate a wide range of proprietary and open-source LLMs including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, PaLM-2, mT5, Gemma, BLOOM and LLaMA on IndicGenBench in a variety of settings. The largest PaLM-2 models performs the best on most tasks, however, there is a significant performance gap in all languages compared to English showing that further research is needed for the development of more inclusive multilingual language models.

We hypothesize that it stems from insufficient explicit supervision during the long-context training, which fails to emphasize that any position in a long context can hold crucial information. Based on this intuition, our study presents information-intensive (IN2) training, a purely data-driven solution to overcome lost-in-the-middle. Specifically, IN2 training leverages a synthesized long-context question-answer dataset, where the answer requires (1) fine-grained information awareness on a short segment (~128 tokens) within a synthesized long context (4K-32K tokens), and (2) the integration and reasoning of information from two or more short segments. Through applying this information-intensive training on Mistral-7B, we present FILM-7B (FILl-in-the-Middle). To thoroughly assess the ability of FILM-7B for utilizing long contexts, we design three probing tasks that encompass various context styles (document, code, and structured-data context) and information retrieval patterns (forward, backward, and bi-directional retrieval). The probing results demonstrate that FILM-7B can robustly retrieve information from different positions in its 32K context window. Beyond these probing tasks, FILM-7B significantly improves the performance on real-world long-context tasks (e.g., 23.5-&gt;26.9 F1 score on NarrativeQA), while maintaining a comparable performance on short-context tasks (e.g., 59.3-&gt;59.2 accuracy on MMLU).

This paper introduces Governance of the Commons Simulation (GovSim), a simulation platform designed to study strategic interactions and cooperative decision-making in LLMs. Through this simulation environment, we explore the dynamics of resource sharing among AI agents, highlighting the importance of ethical considerations, strategic planning, and negotiation skills. GovSim is versatile and supports any text-based agent, including LLMs agents. Using the Generative Agent framework, we create a standard agent that facilitates the integration of different LLMs. Our findings reveal that within GovSim, only two out of 15 tested LLMs managed to achieve a sustainable outcome, indicating a significant gap in the ability of models to manage shared resources. Furthermore, we find that by removing the ability of agents to communicate, they overuse the shared resource, highlighting the importance of communication for cooperation. Interestingly, most LLMs lack the ability to make universalized hypotheses, which highlights a significant weakness in their reasoning skills.

We create a corpus comprising 120 sentences, both ambiguous and unambiguous, for classification, explanation, and disambiguation. The models capability to generate ambiguous sentences was also explored by soliciting sets of sentences for each type of ambiguity. The results underwent qualitative analysis, drawing on recognized linguistic references, and quantitative assessment based on the accuracy of the responses obtained. It was evidenced that even the most sophisticated models, such as ChatGPT and Gemini, exhibit errors and deficiencies in their responses, with explanations often providing inconsistent.

In this paper, we propose leveraging transformer models to distill semantic information from texts in the Wikipedia dataset and its associated categories into a latent space. We then explore different approaches based on these encodings to assess and enhance the semantic identity of the categories. Our graphical approach is powered by Convex Hull, while we utilize Hierarchical Navigable Small Worlds (HNSWs) for the hierarchical approach. As a solution to the information loss caused by the dimensionality reduction, we modulate the following mathematical solution: an exponential decay function driven by the Euclidean distances between the high-dimensional encodings of the textual categories. This function represents a filter built around a contextual category and retrieves items with a certain Reconsideration Probability (RP). Retrieving high-RP items serves as a tool for database administrators to improve data groupings by providing recommendations and identifying outliers within a contextual framework.</p><h4 id="list-items-one-by-one-a-new-data-source-and-learning-paradigm-for-multimodal-llms" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#list-items-one-by-one-a-new-data-source-and-learning-paradigm-for-multimodal-llms"><span>List Items One by One: A New Data Source and Learning Paradigm for Multimodal LLMs</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: An Yan, Zhengyuan Yang, Junda Wu, Wanrong Zhu, Jianwei Yang, Linjie Li, Kevin Lin, Jianfeng Wang, Julian McAuley, Jianfeng Gao, Lijuan Wang</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16375v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16375v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Set-of-Mark (SoM) Prompting unleashes the visual grounding capability of GPT-4V, by enabling the model to associate visual objects with tags inserted on the image. These tags, marked with alphanumerics, can be indexed via text tokens for easy reference. Despite the extraordinary performance from GPT-4V, we observe that other Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle to understand these visual tags. To promote the learning of SoM prompting for open-source models, we propose a new learning paradigm: &quot;list items one by one,&quot; which asks the model to enumerate and describe all visual tags placed on the image following the alphanumeric orders of tags. By integrating our curated dataset with other visual instruction tuning datasets, we are able to equip existing MLLMs with the SoM prompting ability. Furthermore, we evaluate our finetuned SoM models on five MLLM benchmarks. We find that this new dataset, even in a relatively small size (10k-30k images with tags), significantly enhances visual reasoning capabilities and reduces hallucinations for MLLMs. Perhaps surprisingly, these improvements persist even when the visual tags are omitted from input images during inference. This suggests the potential of &quot;list items one by one&quot; as a new paradigm for training MLLMs, which strengthens the object-text alignment through the use of visual tags in the training stage. Finally, we conduct analyses by probing trained models to understand the working mechanism of SoM.

Despite their ability to recognize and avoid harmful queries, LLMs are vulnerable to &quot;jailbreaking&quot; attacks, where carefully crafted prompts elicit them to produce toxic content. One category of jailbreak attacks is reformulating the task as adversarial attacks by eliciting the LLM to generate an affirmative response. However, the typical attack in this category GCG has very limited attack success rate. In this study, to better study the jailbreak attack, we introduce the DSN (Don&#39;t Say No) attack, which prompts LLMs to not only generate affirmative responses but also novelly enhance the objective to suppress refusals. In addition, another challenge lies in jailbreak attacks is the evaluation, as it is difficult to directly and accurately assess the harmfulness of the attack. The existing evaluation such as refusal keyword matching has its own limitation as it reveals numerous false positive and false negative instances. To overcome this challenge, we propose an ensemble evaluation pipeline incorporating Natural Language Inference (NLI) contradiction assessment and two external LLM evaluators. Extensive experiments demonstrate the potency of the DSN and the effectiveness of ensemble evaluation compared to baseline methods.</p><h4 id="when-fuzzing-meets-llms-challenges-and-opportunities" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#when-fuzzing-meets-llms-challenges-and-opportunities"><span>When Fuzzing Meets LLMs: Challenges and Opportunities</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Yu Jiang, Jie Liang, Fuchen Ma, Yuanliang Chen, Chijin Zhou, Yuheng Shen, Zhiyong Wu, Jingzhou Fu, Mingzhe Wang, ShanShan Li, Quan Zhang</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16297v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16297v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Fuzzing, a widely-used technique for bug detection, has seen advancements through Large Language Models (LLMs).

Sifting around these lengthy EHRs is taxing and becomes a cumbersome part of physician-patient interaction. Several approaches have been proposed to help alleviate this prevalent issue either via summarization or sectioning, however, only a few approaches have truly been helpful in the past. With the rise of automated methods, machine learning (ML) has shown promise in solving the task of identifying relevant sections in EHR. However, most ML methods rely on labeled data which is difficult to get in healthcare. Large language models (LLMs) on the other hand, have performed impressive feats in natural language processing (NLP), that too in a zero-shot manner, i.e. without any labeled data. To that end, we propose using LLMs to identify relevant section headers. We find that GPT-4 can effectively solve the task on both zero and few-shot settings as well as segment dramatically better than state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we also annotate a much harder real world dataset and find that GPT-4 struggles to perform well, alluding to further research and harder benchmarks.</p><h4 id="andes-defining-and-enhancing-quality-of-experience-in-llm-based-text-streaming-services" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#andes-defining-and-enhancing-quality-of-experience-in-llm-based-text-streaming-services"><span>Andes: Defining and Enhancing Quality-of-Experience in LLM-Based Text Streaming Services</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Jiachen Liu, Zhiyu Wu, Jae-Won Chung, Fan Lai, Myungjin Lee, Mosharaf Chowdhury</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16283v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16283v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has transformed text-based services, enabling capabilities ranging from real-time translation to AI-driven chatbots. However, existing serving systems primarily focus on optimizing server-side aggregate metrics like token generation throughput, ignoring individual user experience with streamed text. As a result, under high and/or bursty load, a significant number of users can receive unfavorable service quality or poor Quality-of-Experience (QoE). In this paper, we first formally define QoE of text streaming services, where text is delivered incrementally and interactively to users, by considering the end-to-end token delivery process throughout the entire interaction with the user. Thereafter, we propose Andes, a QoE-aware serving system that enhances user experience for LLM-enabled text streaming services. At its core, Andes strategically allocates contended GPU resources among multiple requests over time to optimize their QoE. Our evaluations demonstrate that, compared to the state-of-the-art LLM serving systems like vLLM, Andes improves the average QoE by up to 3.2$\times$ under high request rate, or alternatively, it attains up to 1.6$\times$ higher request rate while preserving high QoE.</p><h2 id="_2024-04-23" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2024-04-23"><span>2024-04-23</span></a></h2><h4 id="aligning-llm-agents-by-learning-latent-preference-from-user-edits" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#aligning-llm-agents-by-learning-latent-preference-from-user-edits"><span>Aligning LLM Agents by Learning Latent Preference from User Edits</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Ge Gao, Alexey Taymanov, Eduardo Salinas, Paul Mineiro, Dipendra Misra</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15269v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15269v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: We study interactive learning of language agents based on user edits made to the agent&#39;s output. In a typical setting such as writing assistants, the user interacts with a language agent to generate a response given a context, and may optionally edit the agent response to personalize it based on their latent preference, in addition to improving the correctness. The edit feedback is naturally generated, making it a suitable candidate for improving the agent&#39;s alignment with the user&#39;s preference, and for reducing the cost of user edits over time. We propose a learning framework, PRELUDE that infers a description of the user&#39;s latent preference based on historic edit data and using it to define a prompt policy that drives future response generation. This avoids fine-tuning the agent, which is costly, challenging to scale with the number of users, and may even degrade its performance on other tasks. Furthermore, learning descriptive preference improves interpretability, allowing the user to view and modify the learned preference. However, user preference can be complex and vary based on context, making it challenging to learn. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective algorithm named CIPHER that leverages a large language model (LLM) to infer the user preference for a given context based on user edits. In the future, CIPHER retrieves inferred preferences from the k-closest contexts in the history, and forms an aggregate preference for response generation. We introduce two interactive environments -- summarization and email writing, for evaluation using a GPT-4 simulated user. We compare with algorithms that directly retrieve user edits but do not learn descriptive preference, and algorithms that learn context-agnostic preference. On both tasks, CIPHER achieves the lowest edit distance cost and learns preferences that show significant similarity to the ground truth preferences</p><h4 id="the-power-of-the-noisy-channel-unsupervised-end-to-end-task-oriented-dialogue-with-llms" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-power-of-the-noisy-channel-unsupervised-end-to-end-task-oriented-dialogue-with-llms"><span>The Power of the Noisy Channel: Unsupervised End-to-End Task-Oriented Dialogue with LLMs</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Brendan King, Jeffrey Flanigan</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15219v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15219v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Training task-oriented dialogue systems typically requires turn-level annotations for interacting with their APIs: e.g. a dialogue state and the system actions taken at each step.

We explain these improvements through mechanistic analyses of factual recall.</p><h4 id="bias-patterns-in-the-application-of-llms-for-clinical-decision-support-a-comprehensive-study" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#bias-patterns-in-the-application-of-llms-for-clinical-decision-support-a-comprehensive-study"><span>Bias patterns in the application of LLMs for clinical decision support: A comprehensive study</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Raphael Poulain, Hamed Fayyaz, Rahmatollah Beheshti</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15149v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15149v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful candidates to inform clinical decision-making processes. While these models play an increasingly prominent role in shaping the digital landscape, two growing concerns emerge in healthcare applications: 1) to what extent do LLMs exhibit social bias based on patients&#39; protected attributes (like race), and 2) how do design choices (like architecture design and prompting strategies) influence the observed biases? To answer these questions rigorously, we evaluated eight popular LLMs across three question-answering (QA) datasets using clinical vignettes (patient descriptions) standardized for bias evaluations. We employ red-teaming strategies to analyze how demographics affect LLM outputs, comparing both general-purpose and clinically-trained models. Our extensive experiments reveal various disparities (some significant) across protected groups. We also observe several counter-intuitive patterns such as larger models not being necessarily less biased and fined-tuned models on medical data not being necessarily better than the general-purpose models. Furthermore, our study demonstrates the impact of prompt design on bias patterns and shows that specific phrasing can influence bias patterns and reflection-type approaches (like Chain of Thought) can reduce biased outcomes effectively. Consistent with prior studies, we call on additional evaluations, scrutiny, and enhancement of LLMs used in clinical decision support applications.</p><h4 id="rethinking-llm-memorization-through-the-lens-of-adversarial-compression" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#rethinking-llm-memorization-through-the-lens-of-adversarial-compression"><span>Rethinking LLM Memorization through the Lens of Adversarial Compression</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Avi Schwarzschild, Zhili Feng, Pratyush Maini, Zachary C.

One major question is whether these models &quot;memorize&quot; all their training data or they integrate many data sources in some way more akin to how a human would learn and synthesize information. The answer hinges, to a large degree, on $\textit{how we define memorization}$. In this work, we propose the Adversarial Compression Ratio (ACR) as a metric for assessing memorization in LLMs -- a given string from the training data is considered memorized if it can be elicited by a prompt shorter than the string itself. In other words, these strings can be &quot;compressed&quot; with the model by computing adversarial prompts of fewer tokens. We outline the limitations of existing notions of memorization and show how the ACR overcomes these challenges by (i) offering an adversarial view to measuring memorization, especially for monitoring unlearning and compliance; and (ii) allowing for the flexibility to measure memorization for arbitrary strings at a reasonably low compute. Our definition serves as a valuable and practical tool for determining when model owners may be violating terms around data usage, providing a potential legal tool and a critical lens through which to address such scenarios.

Subsequently, Our in-depth analysis of various error types has found that deeply understanding the whole problem is critical in addressing complicated reasoning tasks. In this paper, we proposed a novel prompt strategy called Deeply Understanding the Problems (DUP) prompting, inspired by how humans solve complex reasoning problems, designed to enhance the comprehensive understanding of problems by LLMs. It consists of three stages: 1) extract the core question; 2) find out problem-solving information based on the core question; 3) generate and extract answers by LLMs. We evaluate the performance of DUP prompting on ten diverse reasoning datasets. Experimental results suggest that DUP prompting significantly outperforms Zero-Shot CoT ~\cite{kojima2022large} across all datasets. Notably, DUP achieves \textbf{state-of-the-art on SVAMP (90.4% to 94.2%) and GSM8K (94.6% to 97.1%).}</p><h4 id="graph-machine-learning-in-the-era-of-large-language-models-llms" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#graph-machine-learning-in-the-era-of-large-language-models-llms"><span>Graph Machine Learning in the Era of Large Language Models (LLMs)</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Wenqi Fan, Shijie Wang, Jiani Huang, Zhikai Chen, Yu Song, Wenzhuo Tang, Haitao Mao, Hui Liu, Xiaorui Liu, Dawei Yin, Qing Li</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14928v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14928v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Graphs play an important role in representing complex relationships in various domains like social networks, knowledge graphs, and molecular discovery. With the advent of deep learning, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a cornerstone in Graph Machine Learning (Graph ML), facilitating the representation and processing of graph structures. Recently, LLMs have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in language tasks and are widely adopted in a variety of applications such as computer vision and recommender systems. This remarkable success has also attracted interest in applying LLMs to the graph domain. Increasing efforts have been made to explore the potential of LLMs in advancing Graph ML&#39;s generalization, transferability, and few-shot learning ability. Meanwhile, graphs, especially knowledge graphs, are rich in reliable factual knowledge, which can be utilized to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs and potentially alleviate their limitations such as hallucinations and the lack of explainability. Given the rapid progress of this research direction, a systematic review summarizing the latest advancements for Graph ML in the era of LLMs is necessary to provide an in-depth understanding to researchers and practitioners. Therefore, in this survey, we first review the recent developments in Graph ML. We then explore how LLMs can be utilized to enhance the quality of graph features, alleviate the reliance on labeled data, and address challenges such as graph heterogeneity and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Afterward, we delve into how graphs can enhance LLMs, highlighting their abilities to enhance LLM pre-training and inference.

Temporal causal discovery, as an emerging method, aims to identify temporal causal relationships between variables directly from observations by utilizing interventional data. However, existing methods mainly focus on synthetic datasets with heavy reliance on intervention targets and ignore the textual information hidden in real-world systems, failing to conduct causal discovery for real industrial scenarios. To tackle this problem, in this paper we propose to investigate temporal causal discovery in industrial scenarios, which faces two critical challenges: 1) how to discover causal relationships without the interventional targets that are costly to obtain in practice, and 2) how to discover causal relations via leveraging the textual information in systems which can be complex yet abundant in industrial contexts. To address these challenges, we propose the RealTCD framework, which is able to leverage domain knowledge to discover temporal causal relationships without interventional targets. Specifically, we first develop a score-based temporal causal discovery method capable of discovering causal relations for root cause analysis without relying on interventional targets through strategic masking and regularization. Furthermore, by employing Large Language Models (LLMs) to handle texts and integrate domain knowledge, we introduce LLM-guided meta-initialization to extract the meta-knowledge from textual information hidden in systems to boost the quality of discovery. We conduct extensive experiments on simulation and real-world datasets to show the superiority of our proposed RealTCD framework over existing baselines in discovering temporal causal structures.</p><h4 id="med42-evaluating-fine-tuning-strategies-for-medical-llms-full-parameter-vs-parameter-efficient-approaches" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#med42-evaluating-fine-tuning-strategies-for-medical-llms-full-parameter-vs-parameter-efficient-approaches"><span>Med42 -- Evaluating Fine-Tuning Strategies for Medical LLMs: Full-Parameter vs. Parameter-Efficient Approaches</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Clément Christophe, Praveen K Kanithi, Prateek Munjal, Tathagata Raha, Nasir Hayat, Ronnie Rajan, Ahmed Al-Mahrooqi, Avani Gupta, Muhammad Umar Salman, Gurpreet Gosal, Bhargav Kanakiya, Charles Chen, Natalia Vassilieva, Boulbaba Ben Amor, Marco AF Pimentel, Shadab Khan</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14779v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14779v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: This study presents a comprehensive analysis and comparison of two predominant fine-tuning methodologies - full-parameter fine-tuning and parameter-efficient tuning - within the context of medical Large Language Models (LLMs).

Yet LLM-generated evaluators simply inherit all the problems of the LLMs they evaluate, requiring further human validation. We present a mixed-initiative approach to ``validate the validators&#39;&#39; -- aligning LLM-generated evaluation functions (be it prompts or code) with human requirements. Our interface, EvalGen, provides automated assistance to users in generating evaluation criteria and implementing assertions. While generating candidate implementations (Python functions, LLM grader prompts), EvalGen asks humans to grade a subset of LLM outputs; this feedback is used to select implementations that better align with user grades. A qualitative study finds overall support for EvalGen but underscores the subjectivity and iterative process of alignment. In particular, we identify a phenomenon we dub \emph{criteria drift}: users need criteria to grade outputs, but grading outputs helps users define criteria. What is more, some criteria appears \emph{dependent} on the specific LLM outputs observed (rather than independent criteria that can be defined \emph{a priori}), raising serious questions for approaches that assume the independence of evaluation from observation of model outputs. We present our interface and implementation details, a comparison of our algorithm with a baseline approach, and implications for the design of future LLM evaluation assistants.</p><h4 id="toward-self-improvement-of-llms-via-imagination-searching-and-criticizing" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#toward-self-improvement-of-llms-via-imagination-searching-and-criticizing"><span>Toward Self-Improvement of LLMs via Imagination, Searching, and Criticizing</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Ye Tian, Baolin Peng, Linfeng Song, Lifeng Jin, Dian Yu, Haitao Mi, Dong Yu</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12253v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12253v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Despite the impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) on various tasks, they still struggle with scenarios that involves complex reasoning and planning. Recent work proposed advanced prompting techniques and the necessity of fine-tuning with high-quality data to augment LLMs&#39; reasoning abilities. However, these approaches are inherently constrained by data availability and quality. In light of this, self-correction and self-learning emerge as viable solutions, employing strategies that allow LLMs to refine their outputs and learn from self-assessed rewards. Yet, the efficacy of LLMs in self-refining its response, particularly in complex reasoning and planning task, remains dubious. In this paper, we introduce AlphaLLM for the self-improvements of LLMs, which integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with LLMs to establish a self-improving loop, thereby enhancing the capabilities of LLMs without additional annotations. Drawing inspiration from the success of AlphaGo, AlphaLLM addresses the unique challenges of combining MCTS with LLM for self-improvement, including data scarcity, the vastness search spaces of language tasks, and the subjective nature of feedback in language tasks. AlphaLLM is comprised of prompt synthesis component, an efficient MCTS approach tailored for language tasks, and a trio of critic models for precise feedback. Our experimental results in mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that AlphaLLM significantly enhances the performance of LLMs without additional annotations, showing the potential for self-improvement in LLMs.</p><h4 id="aligning-actions-and-walking-to-llm-generated-textual-descriptions" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#aligning-actions-and-walking-to-llm-generated-textual-descriptions"><span>Aligning Actions and Walking to LLM-Generated Textual Descriptions</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Radu Chivereanu, Adrian Cosma, Andy Catruna, Razvan Rughinis, Emilian Radoi</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12192v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12192v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various domains, including data augmentation and synthetic data generation. This work explores the use of LLMs to generate rich textual descriptions for motion sequences, encompassing both actions and walking patterns. We leverage the expressive power of LLMs to align motion representations with high-level linguistic cues, addressing two distinct tasks: action recognition and retrieval of walking sequences based on appearance attributes. For action recognition, we employ LLMs to generate textual descriptions of actions in the BABEL-60 dataset, facilitating the alignment of motion sequences with linguistic representations. In the domain of gait analysis, we investigate the impact of appearance attributes on walking patterns by generating textual descriptions of motion sequences from the DenseGait dataset using LLMs. These descriptions capture subtle variations in walking styles influenced by factors such as clothing choices and footwear. Our approach demonstrates the potential of LLMs in augmenting structured motion attributes and aligning multi-modal representations. The findings contribute to the advancement of comprehensive motion understanding and open up new avenues for leveraging LLMs in multi-modal alignment and data augmentation for motion analysis.

Identifying text segments requiring fact-checking is known as claim detection (CD) and claim check-worthiness detection (CW), the latter incorporating complex domain-specific criteria of worthiness and often framed as a ranking task. Zero- and few-shot LLM prompting is an attractive option for both tasks, as it bypasses the need for labeled datasets and allows verbalized claim and worthiness criteria to be directly used for prompting. We evaluate the LLMs&#39; predictive and calibration accuracy on five CD/CW datasets from diverse domains, each utilizing a different worthiness criterion. We investigate two key aspects: (1) how best to distill factuality and worthiness criteria into a prompt and (2) what amount of context to provide for each claim. To this end, we experiment with varying the level of prompt verbosity and the amount of contextual information provided to the model. Our results show that optimal prompt verbosity is domain-dependent, adding context does not improve performance, and confidence scores can be directly used to produce reliable check-worthiness rankings.</p><h4 id="uncovering-safety-risks-in-open-source-llms-through-concept-activation-vector" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#uncovering-safety-risks-in-open-source-llms-through-concept-activation-vector"><span>Uncovering Safety Risks in Open-source LLMs through Concept Activation Vector</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Zhihao Xu, Ruixuan Huang, Xiting Wang, Fangzhao Wu, Jing Yao, Xing Xie</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12038v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12038v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Current open-source large language models (LLMs) are often undergone careful safety alignment before public release. Some attack methods have also been proposed that help check for safety vulnerabilities in LLMs to ensure alignment robustness. However, many of these methods have moderate attack success rates. Even when successful, the harmfulness of their outputs cannot be guaranteed, leading to suspicions that these methods have not accurately identified the safety vulnerabilities of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce a LLM attack method utilizing concept-based model explanation, where we extract safety concept activation vectors (SCAVs) from LLMs&#39; activation space, enabling efficient attacks on well-aligned LLMs like LLaMA-2, achieving near 100% attack success rate as if LLMs are completely unaligned. This suggests that LLMs, even after thorough safety alignment, could still pose potential risks to society upon public release. To evaluate the harmfulness of outputs resulting with various attack methods, we propose a comprehensive evaluation method that reduces the potential inaccuracies of existing evaluations, and further validate that our method causes more harmful content. Additionally, we discover that the SCAVs show some transferability across different open-source LLMs.</p><h4 id="parafusion-a-large-scale-llm-driven-english-paraphrase-dataset-infused-with-high-quality-lexical-and-syntactic-diversity" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#parafusion-a-large-scale-llm-driven-english-paraphrase-dataset-infused-with-high-quality-lexical-and-syntactic-diversity"><span>ParaFusion: A Large-Scale LLM-Driven English Paraphrase Dataset Infused with High-Quality Lexical and Syntactic Diversity</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Lasal Jayawardena, Prasan Yapa</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12010v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12010v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Paraphrase generation is a pivotal task in natural language processing (NLP). Existing datasets in the domain lack syntactic and lexical diversity, resulting in paraphrases that closely resemble the source sentences. Moreover, these datasets often contain hate speech and noise, and may unintentionally include non-English language sentences. This research introduces ParaFusion, a large-scale, high-quality English paraphrase dataset developed using Large Language Models (LLM) to address these challenges. ParaFusion augments existing datasets with high-quality data, significantly enhancing both lexical and syntactic diversity while maintaining close semantic similarity. It also mitigates the presence of hate speech and reduces noise, ensuring a cleaner and more focused English dataset. Results show that ParaFusion offers at least a 25% improvement in both syntactic and lexical diversity, measured across several metrics for each data source. The paper also aims to set a gold standard for paraphrase evaluation as it contains one of the most comprehensive evaluation strategies to date. The results underscore the potential of ParaFusion as a valuable resource for improving NLP applications.</p><h4 id="generating-diverse-criteria-on-the-fly-to-improve-point-wise-llm-rankers" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#generating-diverse-criteria-on-the-fly-to-improve-point-wise-llm-rankers"><span>Generating Diverse Criteria On-the-Fly to Improve Point-wise LLM Rankers</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Fang Guo, Wenyu Li, Honglei Zhuang, Yun Luo, Yafu Li, Le Yan, Yue Zhang</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11960v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11960v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: The most recent pointwise Large Language Model (LLM) rankers have achieved remarkable ranking results.

While utilizing natural language to coordinate multiple agents presents a promising avenue for democratizing agent technology for general users, designing coordination strategies remains challenging with existing coordination frameworks. This difficulty stems from the inherent ambiguity of natural language for specifying the collaboration process and the significant cognitive effort required to extract crucial information (e.g. agent relationship, task dependency, result correspondence) from a vast amount of text-form content during exploration. In this work, we present a visual exploration framework to facilitate the design of coordination strategies in multi-agent collaboration. We first establish a structured representation for LLM-based multi-agent coordination strategy to regularize the ambiguity of natural language. Based on this structure, we devise a three-stage generation method that leverages LLMs to convert a user&#39;s general goal into an executable initial coordination strategy. Users can further intervene at any stage of the generation process, utilizing LLMs and a set of interactions to explore alternative strategies. Whenever a satisfactory strategy is identified, users can commence the collaboration and examine the visually enhanced execution result. We develop AgentCoord, a prototype interactive system, and conduct a formal user study to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach.</p><h4 id="concept-induction-using-llms-a-user-experiment-for-assessment" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#concept-induction-using-llms-a-user-experiment-for-assessment"><span>Concept Induction using LLMs: a user experiment for assessment</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Adrita Barua, Cara Widmer, Pascal Hitzler</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11875v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11875v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) poses a significant challenge in providing transparent and understandable insights into complex AI models. Traditional post-hoc algorithms, while useful, often struggle to deliver interpretable explanations. Concept-based models offer a promising avenue by incorporating explicit representations of concepts to enhance interpretability. However, existing research on automatic concept discovery methods is often limited by lower-level concepts, costly human annotation requirements, and a restricted domain of background knowledge. In this study, we explore the potential of a Large Language Model (LLM), specifically GPT-4, by leveraging its domain knowledge and common-sense capability to generate high-level concepts that are meaningful as explanations for humans, for a specific setting of image classification. We use minimal textual object information available in the data via prompting to facilitate this process. To evaluate the output, we compare the concepts generated by the LLM with two other methods: concepts generated by humans and the ECII heuristic concept induction system. Since there is no established metric to determine the human understandability of concepts, we conducted a human study to assess the effectiveness of the LLM-generated concepts. Our findings indicate that while human-generated explanations remain superior, concepts derived from GPT-4 are more comprehensible to humans compared to those generated by ECII.</p><h4 id="from-image-to-video-what-do-we-need-in-multimodal-llms" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#from-image-to-video-what-do-we-need-in-multimodal-llms"><span>From Image to Video, what do we need in multimodal LLMs?</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Suyuan Huang, Haoxin Zhang, Yan Gao, Yao Hu, Zengchang Qin</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11865v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11865v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated profound capabilities in understanding multimodal information, covering from Image LLMs to the more complex Video LLMs. Numerous studies have illustrated their exceptional cross-modal comprehension.

Despite its importance, existing studies in CRS lack a study about how to measure such behavior discrepancy. To fill this gap, we propose Behavior Alignment, a new evaluation metric to measure how well the recommendation strategies made by a LLM-based CRS are consistent with human recommenders&#39;. Our experiment results show that the new metric is better aligned with human preferences and can better differentiate how systems perform than existing evaluation metrics. As Behavior Alignment requires explicit and costly human annotations on the recommendation strategies, we also propose a classification-based method to implicitly measure the Behavior Alignment based on the responses.

As a result, they struggle with infrequent knowledge and temporal degradation. In addition, the uninterpretable nature of parametric memorization makes it challenging to understand and prevent hallucination. Parametric memory pools and model editing are only partial solutions. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) $\unicode{x2013}$ though non-parametric $\unicode{x2013}$ has its own limitations: it lacks structure, complicates interpretability and makes it hard to effectively manage stored knowledge. In this paper, we introduce MemLLM, a novel method of enhancing LLMs by integrating a structured and explicit read-and-write memory module. MemLLM tackles the aforementioned challenges by enabling dynamic interaction with the memory and improving the LLM&#39;s capabilities in using stored knowledge. Our experiments indicate that MemLLM enhances the LLM&#39;s performance and interpretability, in language modeling in general and knowledge-intensive tasks in particular. We see MemLLM as an important step towards making LLMs more grounded and factual through memory augmentation.</p><h4 id="pack-of-llms-model-fusion-at-test-time-via-perplexity-optimization" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#pack-of-llms-model-fusion-at-test-time-via-perplexity-optimization"><span>Pack of LLMs: Model Fusion at Test-Time via Perplexity Optimization</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Costas Mavromatis, Petros Karypis, George Karypis</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11531v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11531v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Fusing knowledge from multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) can combine their diverse strengths to achieve improved performance on a given task. However, current fusion approaches either rely on learning-based fusers that do not generalize to new LLMs, or do not take into account how well each LLM understands the input. In this work, we study LLM fusion at test-time, which enables leveraging knowledge from arbitrary user-specified LLMs during inference. We introduce Pack of LLMs (PackLLM), an effective method for test-time fusion that leverages each LLM&#39;s expertise, given an input prompt. PackLLM performs model fusion by solving an optimization problem for determining each LLM&#39;s importance, so that perplexity over the input prompt is minimized. First, our simple PackLLM-sim variant validates that perplexity is a good indicator for measuring each LLM&#39;s expertise. Second, our PackLLM-opt variant approximately solves the perplexity minimization problem via a greedy algorithm. The derived importance weights are used to combine the LLMs during inference. We conduct experiments with over 100 total LLMs on a diverse set of tasks. Experimental results show that (i) perplexity is a reliable measure for LLM fusion, (ii) PackLLM outperforms test-time fusion baselines by 1.89% accuracy points, and (iii) PackLLM can leverage new LLMs to improve performance over learning-based fusion approaches by 3.92-11.94% accuracy points.</p><h4 id="from-image-to-uml-first-results-of-image-based-uml-diagram-generation-using-llms" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#from-image-to-uml-first-results-of-image-based-uml-diagram-generation-using-llms"><span>From Image to UML: First Results of Image Based UML Diagram Generation Using LLMs</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Aaron Conrardy, Jordi Cabot</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11376v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11376v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: In software engineering processes, systems are first specified using a modeling language such as UML. These initial designs are often collaboratively created, many times in meetings where different domain experts use whiteboards, paper or other types of quick supports to create drawings and blueprints that then will need to be formalized. These proper, machine-readable, models are key to ensure models can be part of automated processes (e.g. input of a low-code generation pipeline, a model-based testing system, ...). But going form hand-drawn diagrams to actual models is a time-consuming process that sometimes ends up with such drawings just added as informal images to the software documentation, reducing their value a lot. To avoid this tedious task, we explore the usage of Large Language Models (LLM) to generate the formal representation of (UML) models from a given drawing. More specifically, we have evaluated the capabilities of different LLMs to convert images of UML class diagrams into the actual models represented in the images. While the results are good enough to use such an approach as part of a model-driven engineering pipeline we also highlight some of their current limitations and the need to keep the human in the loop to overcome those limitations.</p><h4 id="large-language-models-meet-collaborative-filtering-an-efficient-all-round-llm-based-recommender-system" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#large-language-models-meet-collaborative-filtering-an-efficient-all-round-llm-based-recommender-system"><span>Large Language Models meet Collaborative Filtering: An Efficient All-round LLM-based Recommender System</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Sein Kim, Hongseok Kang, Seungyoon Choi, Donghyun Kim, Minchul Yang, Chanyoung Park</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11343v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11343v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Collaborative filtering recommender systems (CF-RecSys) have shown successive results in enhancing the user experience on social media and e-commerce platforms. However, as CF-RecSys struggles under cold scenarios with sparse user-item interactions, recent strategies have focused on leveraging modality information of user/items (e.g., text or images) based on pre-trained modality encoders and Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite their effectiveness under cold scenarios, we observe that they underperform simple traditional collaborative filtering models under warm scenarios due to the lack of collaborative knowledge. In this work, we propose an efficient All-round LLM-based Recommender system, called A-LLMRec, that excels not only in the cold scenario but also in the warm scenario. Our main idea is to enable an LLM to directly leverage the collaborative knowledge contained in a pre-trained state-of-the-art CF-RecSys so that the emergent ability of the LLM as well as the high-quality user/item embeddings that are already trained by the state-of-the-art CF-RecSys can be jointly exploited. This approach yields two advantages: (1) model-agnostic, allowing for integration with various existing CF-RecSys, and (2) efficiency, eliminating the extensive fine-tuning typically required for LLM-based recommenders. Our extensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of A-LLMRec in various scenarios, including cold/warm, few-shot, cold user, and cross-domain scenarios. Beyond the recommendation task, we also show the potential of A-LLMRec in generating natural language outputs based on the understanding of the collaborative knowledge by performing a favorite genre prediction task.

Essentially, robots need to understand which actions each object affords, and where those affordances can be acted on. Robots are ultimately expected to operate in unstructured human environments, where the set of objects and affordances is not known to the robot before deployment (i.e. the open-vocabulary setting). In this work, we introduce OVAL-Prompt, a prompt-based approach for open-vocabulary affordance localization in RGB-D images. By leveraging a Vision Language Model (VLM) for open-vocabulary object part segmentation and a Large Language Model (LLM) to ground each part-segment-affordance, OVAL-Prompt demonstrates generalizability to novel object instances, categories, and affordances without domain-specific finetuning. Quantitative experiments demonstrate that without any finetuning, OVAL-Prompt achieves localization accuracy that is competitive with supervised baseline models. Moreover, qualitative experiments show that OVAL-Prompt enables affordance-based robot manipulation of open-vocabulary object instances and categories.</p><h2 id="_2024-04-16" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2024-04-16"><span>2024-04-16</span></a></h2><h4 id="uncertainty-based-abstention-in-llms-improves-safety-and-reduces-hallucinations" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#uncertainty-based-abstention-in-llms-improves-safety-and-reduces-hallucinations"><span>Uncertainty-Based Abstention in LLMs Improves Safety and Reduces Hallucinations</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Christian Tomani, Kamalika Chaudhuri, Ivan Evtimov, Daniel Cremers, Mark Ibrahim</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10960v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10960v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: A major barrier towards the practical deployment of large language models (LLMs) is their lack of reliability. Three situations where this is particularly apparent are correctness, hallucinations when given unanswerable questions, and safety. In all three cases, models should ideally abstain from responding, much like humans, whose ability to understand uncertainty makes us refrain from answering questions we don&#39;t know. Inspired by analogous approaches in classification, this study explores the feasibility and efficacy of abstaining while uncertain in the context of LLMs within the domain of question-answering. We investigate two kinds of uncertainties, statistical uncertainty metrics and a distinct verbalized measure, termed as In-Dialogue Uncertainty (InDU). Using these uncertainty measures combined with models with and without Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF), we show that in all three situations, abstention based on the right kind of uncertainty measure can boost the reliability of LLMs. By sacrificing only a few highly uncertain samples we can improve correctness by 2% to 8%, avoid 50% hallucinations via correctly identifying unanswerable questions and increase safety by 70% up to 99% with almost no additional computational overhead.</p><h4 id="llmem-estimating-gpu-memory-usage-for-fine-tuning-pre-trained-llms" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#llmem-estimating-gpu-memory-usage-for-fine-tuning-pre-trained-llms"><span>LLMem: Estimating GPU Memory Usage for Fine-Tuning Pre-Trained LLMs</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Taeho Kim, Yanming Wang, Vatshank Chaturvedi, Lokesh Gupta, Seyeon Kim, Yongin Kwon, Sangtae Ha</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10933v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10933v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) with limited hardware presents challenges due to GPU memory constraints.

An example of a token factory using weight compression and sharing is also given.</p><h4 id="incubating-text-classifiers-following-user-instruction-with-nothing-but-llm" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#incubating-text-classifiers-following-user-instruction-with-nothing-but-llm"><span>Incubating Text Classifiers Following User Instruction with Nothing but LLM</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Letian Peng, Jingbo Shang</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10877v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10877v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: In this paper, we aim to generate text classification data given arbitrary class definitions (i.e., user instruction), so one can train a small text classifier without any human annotation or raw corpus. Compared with pioneer attempts, our proposed Incubator is the first framework that can handle complicated and even mutually dependent classes (e.g., &quot;TED Talk given by Educator&quot; and &quot;Other&quot;). Specifically, Incubator is an LLM firstly tuned on the instruction-to-data mappings that we obtained from classification datasets and descriptions on HuggingFace together with in-context augmentation by GPT-4. We then refine Incubator by learning on the cluster centers of semantic textual embeddings to emphasize the uniformity and semantic diversity in generations. We compare Incubator on various classification tasks with strong baselines such as direct LLM-based inference and training data generation by prompt engineering. Experiments show Incubator is able to (1) perform well on traditional benchmarks, (2) take label dependency and user preference into consideration, and (3) enable logical text mining by incubating multiple classifiers.</p><h4 id="minicheck-efficient-fact-checking-of-llms-on-grounding-documents" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#minicheck-efficient-fact-checking-of-llms-on-grounding-documents"><span>MiniCheck: Efficient Fact-Checking of LLMs on Grounding Documents</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Liyan Tang, Philippe Laban, Greg Durrett</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10774v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10774v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Recognizing if LLM output can be grounded in evidence is central to many tasks in NLP: retrieval-augmented generation, summarization, document-grounded dialogue, and more. Current approaches to this kind of &quot;fact-checking&quot; are based on verifying each piece of a model generation against potential evidence using an LLM. However, this process can be very computationally expensive, requiring many calls to LLMs to check a single response. In this work, we show how to build small models that have GPT-4-level performance but for 400x lower cost. We do this by constructing synthetic training data with GPT-4, which involves creating realistic yet challenging instances of factual errors via a structured generation procedure. Training on this data teaches models to check each fact in the claim and recognize synthesis of information across sentences. For evaluation, we unify pre-existing datasets into a benchmark LLM-AggreFact, collected from recent work on fact-checking and grounding LLM generations. Our best system MiniCheck-FT5 (770M parameters) outperforms all systems of comparable size and reaches GPT-4 accuracy.

With the rapid advancement of machine learning techniques, it can be effectively processed to extract astronomical patterns and information. In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation of deep-learning and large language model (LLM) based models for the automatic classification of variable star light curves, based on large datasets from the Kepler and K2 missions. Special emphasis is placed on Cepheids, RR Lyrae, and eclipsing binaries, examining the influence of observational cadence and phase distribution on classification precision. Employing AutoDL optimization, we achieve striking performance with the 1D-Convolution+BiLSTM architecture and the Swin Transformer, hitting accuracies of 94% and 99% correspondingly, with the latter demonstrating a notable 83% accuracy in discerning the elusive Type II Cepheids-comprising merely 0.02% of the total dataset.We unveil StarWhisper LightCurve (LC), an innovative Series comprising three LLM-based models: LLM, multimodal large language model (MLLM), and Large Audio Language Model (LALM). Each model is fine-tuned with strategic prompt engineering and customized training methods to explore the emergent abilities of these models for astronomical data. Remarkably, StarWhisper LC Series exhibit high accuracies around 90%, significantly reducing the need for explicit feature engineering, thereby paving the way for streamlined parallel data processing and the progression of multifaceted multimodal models in astronomical applications. The study furnishes two detailed catalogs illustrating the impacts of phase and sampling intervals on deep learning classification accuracy, showing that a substantial decrease of up to 14% in observation duration and 21% in sampling points can be realized without compromising accuracy by more than 10%.</p><h4 id="is-dpo-superior-to-ppo-for-llm-alignment-a-comprehensive-study" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#is-dpo-superior-to-ppo-for-llm-alignment-a-comprehensive-study"><span>Is DPO Superior to PPO for LLM Alignment?

Existing RLHF methods can be roughly categorized as either reward-based or reward-free. Novel applications such as ChatGPT and Claude leverage reward-based methods that first learn a reward model and apply actor-critic algorithms, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). However, in academic benchmarks, state-of-the-art results are often achieved via reward-free methods, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Is DPO truly superior to PPO? Why does PPO perform poorly on these benchmarks? In this paper, we first conduct both theoretical and empirical studies on the algorithmic properties of DPO and show that DPO may have fundamental limitations. Moreover, we also comprehensively examine PPO and reveal the key factors for the best performances of PPO in fine-tuning LLMs. Finally, we benchmark DPO and PPO across various a collection of RLHF testbeds, ranging from dialogue to code generation. Experiment results demonstrate that PPO is able to surpass other alignment methods in all cases and achieve state-of-the-art results in challenging code competitions.</p><h4 id="automating-rest-api-postman-test-cases-using-llm" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#automating-rest-api-postman-test-cases-using-llm"><span>Automating REST API Postman Test Cases Using LLM</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: S Deepika Sri, Mohammed Aadil S, Sanjjushri Varshini R, Raja CSP Raman, Gopinath Rajagopal, S Taranath Chan</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10678v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10678v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: In the contemporary landscape of technological advancements, the automation of manual processes is crucial, compelling the demand for huge datasets to effectively train and test machines. This research paper is dedicated to the exploration and implementation of an automated approach to generate test cases specifically using Large Language Models. The methodology integrates the use of Open AI to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of test case generation for training and evaluating Large Language Models. This formalized approach with LLMs simplifies the testing process, making it more efficient and comprehensive. Leveraging natural language understanding, LLMs can intelligently formulate test cases that cover a broad range of REST API properties, ensuring comprehensive testing. The model that is developed during the research is trained using manually collected postman test cases or instances for various Rest APIs. LLMs enhance the creation of Postman test cases by automating the generation of varied and intricate test scenarios. Postman test cases offer streamlined automation, collaboration, and dynamic data handling, providing a user-friendly and efficient approach to API testing compared to traditional test cases.

In this game, an attacker and a defender communicate with respect to a target word only visible to the attacker. The attacker aims to induce the defender to utter the target word unconsciously, while the defender tries to infer the target word from the attacker&#39;s utterances. To win the game, both players should have sufficient knowledge about the target word and high-level reasoning ability to infer and express in this information-reserved conversation. Hence, we are curious about whether LLMs&#39; reasoning ability can be further enhanced by Self-Play in this Adversarial language Game (SPAG). With this goal, we let LLMs act as the attacker and play with a copy of itself as the defender on an extensive range of target words. Through reinforcement learning on the game outcomes, we observe that the LLMs&#39; performance uniformly improves on a broad range of reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, iteratively adopting this self-play process can continuously promote LLM&#39;s reasoning ability.

However, a primary constraint they face is the context limit, i.e., the maximum number of tokens they can process. Previous works have explored architectural changes and modifications in positional encoding to relax the constraint, but they often require expensive training or do not address the computational demands of self-attention. In this paper, we present Hierarchical cOntext MERging (HOMER), a new training-free scheme designed to overcome the limitations. HOMER uses a divide-and-conquer algorithm, dividing long inputs into manageable chunks. Each chunk is then processed collectively, employing a hierarchical strategy that merges adjacent chunks at progressive transformer layers. A token reduction technique precedes each merging, ensuring memory usage efficiency. We also propose an optimized computational order reducing the memory requirement to logarithmically scale with respect to input length, making it especially favorable for environments with tight memory restrictions. Our experiments demonstrate the proposed method&#39;s superior performance and memory efficiency, enabling the broader use of LLMs in contexts requiring extended context.

Large Language Models (LLMs) can be prompted to produce test inputs and oracles for a program directly, but the precision of the tests can be very low for complex scenarios (only 6.3% based on our experiments). To fill this gap, this paper proposes AID, which combines LLMs with differential testing to generate fault-revealing test inputs and oracles targeting plausibly correct programs (i.e., programs that have passed all the existing tests). In particular, AID selects test inputs that yield diverse outputs on a set of program variants generated by LLMs, then constructs the test oracle based on the outputs. We evaluate AID on two large-scale datasets with tricky bugs: TrickyBugs and EvalPlus, and compare it with three state-of-the-art baselines. The evaluation results show that the recall, precision, and F1 score of AID outperform the state-of-the-art by up to 1.80x, 2.65x, and 1.66x, respectively.</p><h4 id="uncovering-latent-arguments-in-social-media-messaging-by-employing-llms-in-the-loop-strategy" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#uncovering-latent-arguments-in-social-media-messaging-by-employing-llms-in-the-loop-strategy"><span>Uncovering Latent Arguments in Social Media Messaging by Employing LLMs-in-the-Loop Strategy</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Tunazzina Islam, Dan Goldwasser</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10259v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10259v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: The widespread use of social media has led to a surge in popularity for automated methods of analyzing public opinion. Supervised methods are adept at text categorization, yet the dynamic nature of social media discussions poses a continual challenge for these techniques due to the constant shifting of the focus. On the other hand, traditional unsupervised methods for extracting themes from public discourse, such as topic modeling, often reveal overarching patterns that might not capture specific nuances. Consequently, a significant portion of research into social media discourse still depends on labor-intensive manual coding techniques and a human-in-the-loop approach, which are both time-consuming and costly. In this work, we study the problem of discovering arguments associated with a specific theme. We propose a generic LLMs-in-the-Loop strategy that leverages the advanced capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract latent arguments from social media messaging. To demonstrate our approach, we apply our framework to contentious topics. We use two publicly available datasets: (1) the climate campaigns dataset of 14k Facebook ads with 25 themes and (2) the COVID-19 vaccine campaigns dataset of 9k Facebook ads with 14 themes. Furthermore, we analyze demographic targeting and the adaptation of messaging based on real-world events.</p><h4 id="how-faithful-are-rag-models-quantifying-the-tug-of-war-between-rag-and-llms-internal-prior" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-faithful-are-rag-models-quantifying-the-tug-of-war-between-rag-and-llms-internal-prior"><span>How faithful are RAG models?

However, in cases when the LLM alone incorrectly answers a question, does providing the correct retrieved content always fix the error? Conversely, in cases where the retrieved content is incorrect, does the LLM know to ignore the wrong information, or does it recapitulate the error? To answer these questions, we systematically analyze the tug-of-war between a LLM&#39;s internal knowledge (i.e. its prior) and the retrieved information in settings when they disagree. We test GPT-4 and other LLMs on question-answering abilities across datasets with and without reference documents. As expected, providing the correct retrieved information fixes most model mistakes (94% accuracy). However, when the reference document is perturbed with increasing levels of wrong values, the LLM is more likely to recite the incorrect, modified information when its internal prior is weaker but is more resistant when its prior is stronger. Similarly, we also find that the more the modified information deviates from the model&#39;s prior, the less likely the model is to prefer it. These results highlight an underlying tension between a model&#39;s prior knowledge and the information presented in reference documents.</p><h2 id="_2024-04-15" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2024-04-15"><span>2024-04-15</span></a></h2><h4 id="deceiving-to-enlighten-coaxing-llms-to-self-reflection-for-enhanced-bias-detection-and-mitigation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#deceiving-to-enlighten-coaxing-llms-to-self-reflection-for-enhanced-bias-detection-and-mitigation"><span>Deceiving to Enlighten: Coaxing LLMs to Self-Reflection for Enhanced Bias Detection and Mitigation</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Ruoxi Cheng, Haoxuan Ma, Shuirong Cao</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10160v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10160v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Large Language Models (LLMs) embed complex biases and stereotypes that can lead to detrimental user experiences and societal consequences, often without conscious awareness from the models themselves. This paper emphasizes the importance of equipping LLMs with mechanisms for better self-reflection and bias recognition. Our experiments demonstrate that by informing LLMs that their generated content does not represent their own views and questioning them about bias, their capability to identify and address biases improves. This enhancement is attributed to the internal attention mechanisms and potential internal sensitivity policies of LLMs. Building upon these findings, we propose a novel method to diminish bias in LLM outputs. This involves engaging LLMs in multi-role scenarios acting as different roles where they are tasked for bias exposure, with a role of an impartial referee in the end of each loop of debate. A ranking scoring mechanism is employed to quantify bias levels, enabling more refined reflections and superior output quality. Comparative experimental results confirm that our method outperforms existing approaches in reducing bias, making it a valuable contribution to efforts towards more ethical AI systems.</p><h4 id="tabsqlify-enhancing-reasoning-capabilities-of-llms-through-table-decomposition" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#tabsqlify-enhancing-reasoning-capabilities-of-llms-through-table-decomposition"><span>TabSQLify: Enhancing Reasoning Capabilities of LLMs Through Table Decomposition</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Md Mahadi Hasan Nahid, Davood Rafiei</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10150v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10150v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Table reasoning is a challenging task that requires understanding both natural language questions and structured tabular data. Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, but they often struggle with large tables due to their limited input length. In this paper, we propose TabSQLify, a novel method that leverages text-to-SQL generation to decompose tables into smaller and relevant sub-tables, containing only essential information for answering questions or verifying statements, before performing the reasoning task. In our comprehensive evaluation on four challenging datasets, our approach demonstrates comparable or superior performance compared to prevailing methods reliant on full tables as input. Moreover, our method can reduce the input context length significantly, making it more scalable and efficient for large-scale table reasoning applications. Our method performs remarkably well on the WikiTQ benchmark, achieving an accuracy of 64.7%. Additionally, on the TabFact benchmark, it achieves a high accuracy of 79.5%. These results surpass other LLM-based baseline models on gpt-3.5-turbo (chatgpt). TabSQLify can reduce the table size significantly alleviating the computational load on LLMs when handling large tables without compromising performance.</p><h4 id="anchor-llm-driven-news-subject-conditioning-for-text-to-image-synthesis" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#anchor-llm-driven-news-subject-conditioning-for-text-to-image-synthesis"><span>ANCHOR: LLM-driven News Subject Conditioning for Text-to-Image Synthesis</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Aashish Anantha Ramakrishnan, Sharon X.

Real-world news image captions take a more pragmatic approach, providing high-level situational and Named-Entity (NE) information and limited physical object descriptions, making them abstractive. To evaluate the ability of T2I models to capture intended subjects from news captions, we introduce the Abstractive News Captions with High-level cOntext Representation (ANCHOR) dataset, containing 70K+ samples sourced from 5 different news media organizations. With Large Language Models (LLM) achieving success in language and commonsense reasoning tasks, we explore the ability of different LLMs to identify and understand key subjects from abstractive captions. Our proposed method Subject-Aware Finetuning (SAFE), selects and enhances the representation of key subjects in synthesized images by leveraging LLM-generated subject weights. It also adapts to the domain distribution of news images and captions through custom Domain Fine-tuning, outperforming current T2I baselines on ANCHOR. By launching the ANCHOR dataset, we hope to motivate research in furthering the Natural Language Understanding (NLU) capabilities of T2I models.</p><h4 id="llm-based-test-driven-interactive-code-generation-user-study-and-empirical-evaluation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#llm-based-test-driven-interactive-code-generation-user-study-and-empirical-evaluation"><span>LLM-based Test-driven Interactive Code Generation: User Study and Empirical Evaluation</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Sarah Fakhoury, Aaditya Naik, Georgios Sakkas, Saikat Chakraborty, Shuvendu K.

In this paper, we propose a novel interactive workflow TiCoder for guided intent clarification (i.e., partial formalization) through tests to support the generation of more accurate code suggestions. Through a mixed methods user study with 15 programmers, we present an empirical evaluation of the effectiveness of the workflow to improve code generation accuracy. We find that participants using the proposed workflow are significantly more likely to correctly evaluate AI generated code, and report significantly less task-induced cognitive load.

We observe an average absolute improvement of 38.43% in the pass@1 code generation accuracy for both datasets and across all LLMs within 5 user interactions, in addition to the automatic generation of accompanying unit tests.</p><h4 id="constructing-benchmarks-and-interventions-for-combating-hallucinations-in-llms" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#constructing-benchmarks-and-interventions-for-combating-hallucinations-in-llms"><span>Constructing Benchmarks and Interventions for Combating Hallucinations in LLMs</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Adi Simhi, Jonathan Herzig, Idan Szpektor, Yonatan Belinkov</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09971v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09971v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Large language models (LLMs) are susceptible to hallucination, which sparked a widespread effort to detect and prevent them. Recent work attempts to mitigate hallucinations by intervening in the model&#39;s computation during generation, using different setups and heuristics.

In this work, we first introduce an approach for constructing datasets based on the model knowledge for detection and intervention methods in closed-book and open-book question-answering settings. We then characterize the effect of different choices for intervention, such as the intervened components (MLPs, attention block, residual stream, and specific heads), and how often and how strongly to intervene. We find that intervention success varies depending on the component, with some components being detrimental to language modeling capabilities. Finally, we find that interventions can benefit from pre-hallucination steering direction instead of post-hallucination.

Recent explorations have utilized LVLMs to tackle zero-shot visual anomaly detection (VAD) challenges by pairing images with textual descriptions indicative of normal and abnormal conditions, referred to as anomaly prompts. However, existing approaches depend on static anomaly prompts that are prone to cross-semantic ambiguity, and prioritize global image-level representations over crucial local pixel-level image-to-text alignment that is necessary for accurate anomaly localization. In this paper, we present ALFA, a training-free approach designed to address these challenges via a unified model. We propose a run-time prompt adaptation strategy, which first generates informative anomaly prompts to leverage the capabilities of a large language model (LLM). This strategy is enhanced by a contextual scoring mechanism for per-image anomaly prompt adaptation and cross-semantic ambiguity mitigation. We further introduce a novel fine-grained aligner to fuse local pixel-level semantics for precise anomaly localization, by projecting the image-text alignment from global to local semantic spaces. Extensive evaluations on the challenging MVTec and VisA datasets confirm ALFA&#39;s effectiveness in harnessing the language potential for zero-shot VAD, achieving significant PRO improvements of 12.1% on MVTec AD and 8.9% on VisA compared to state-of-the-art zero-shot VAD approaches.</p><h4 id="bridging-the-gap-between-different-vocabularies-for-llm-ensemble" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#bridging-the-gap-between-different-vocabularies-for-llm-ensemble"><span>Bridging the Gap between Different Vocabularies for LLM Ensemble</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Yangyifan Xu, Jinliang Lu, Jiajun Zhang</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09492v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09492v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Ensembling different large language models (LLMs) to unleash their complementary potential and harness their individual strengths is highly valuable. Nevertheless, vocabulary discrepancies among various LLMs have constrained previous studies to either selecting or blending completely generated outputs. This limitation hinders the dynamic correction and enhancement of outputs during the generation process, resulting in a limited capacity for effective ensemble. To address this issue, we propose a novel method to Ensemble LLMs via Vocabulary Alignment (EVA). EVA bridges the lexical gap among various LLMs, enabling meticulous ensemble at each generation step. Specifically, we first learn mappings between the vocabularies of different LLMs with the assistance of overlapping tokens. Subsequently, these mappings are employed to project output distributions of LLMs into a unified space, facilitating a fine-grained ensemble. Finally, we design a filtering strategy to exclude models that generate unfaithful tokens. Experimental results on commonsense reasoning, arithmetic reasoning, machine translation, and data-to-text generation tasks demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared with individual LLMs and previous ensemble methods conducted on complete outputs. Further analyses confirm that our approach can leverage knowledge from different language models and yield consistent improvement.</p><h2 id="_2024-04-14" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2024-04-14"><span>2024-04-14</span></a></h2><h4 id="tasks-people-prompt-a-taxonomy-of-llm-downstream-tasks-in-software-verification-and-falsification-approaches" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#tasks-people-prompt-a-taxonomy-of-llm-downstream-tasks-in-software-verification-and-falsification-approaches"><span>Tasks People Prompt: A Taxonomy of LLM Downstream Tasks in Software Verification and Falsification Approaches</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Víctor A.

For such goal, we develop a novel downstream task taxonomy that enables pinpointing some engineering patterns in a rather varied spectrum of Software Engineering problems that encompasses testing, fuzzing, debugging, vulnerability detection, static analysis and program verification approaches.</p><h4 id="towards-practical-tool-usage-for-continually-learning-llms" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#towards-practical-tool-usage-for-continually-learning-llms"><span>Towards Practical Tool Usage for Continually Learning LLMs</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Jerry Huang, Prasanna Parthasarathi, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh, Sarath Chandar</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09339v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09339v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Large language models (LLMs) show an innate skill for solving language based tasks. But insights have suggested an inability to adjust for information or task-solving skills becoming outdated, as their knowledge, stored directly within their parameters, remains static in time. Tool use helps by offloading work to systems that the LLM can access through an interface, but LLMs that use them still must adapt to nonstationary environments for prolonged use, as new tools can emerge and existing tools can change. Nevertheless, tools require less specialized knowledge, therefore we hypothesize they are better suited for continual learning (CL) as they rely less on parametric memory for solving tasks and instead focus on learning when to apply pre-defined tools. To verify this, we develop a synthetic benchmark and follow this by aggregating existing NLP tasks to form a more realistic testing scenario. While we demonstrate scaling model size is not a solution, regardless of tool usage, continual learning techniques can enable tool LLMs to both adapt faster while forgetting less, highlighting their potential as continual learners.</p><h4 id="large-language-models-are-as-persuasive-as-humans-but-why-about-the-cognitive-effort-and-moral-emotional-language-of-llm-arguments" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#large-language-models-are-as-persuasive-as-humans-but-why-about-the-cognitive-effort-and-moral-emotional-language-of-llm-arguments"><span>Large Language Models are as persuasive as humans, but why?

However, we know very little about why. This paper investigates the persuasion strategies of LLMs, comparing them with human-generated arguments. Using a dataset of 1,251 participants in an experiment, we analyze the persuaion strategies of LLM-generated and human-generated arguments using measures of cognitive effort (lexical and grammatical complexity) and moral-emotional language (sentiment and moral analysis). The study reveals that LLMs produce arguments that require higher cognitive effort, exhibiting more complex grammatical and lexical structures than human counterparts. Additionally, LLMs demonstrate a significant propensity to engage more deeply with moral language, utilizing both positive and negative moral foundations more frequently than humans. In contrast with previous research, no significant difference was found in the emotional content produced by LLMs and humans. These findings contribute to the discourse on AI and persuasion, highlighting the dual potential of LLMs to both enhance and undermine informational integrity through communication strategies for digital persuasion.</p><h4 id="cross-data-knowledge-graph-construction-for-llm-enabled-educational-question-answering-system-a-case-study-at-hcmut" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#cross-data-knowledge-graph-construction-for-llm-enabled-educational-question-answering-system-a-case-study-at-hcmut"><span>Cross-Data Knowledge Graph Construction for LLM-enabled Educational Question-Answering System: A~Case~Study~at~HCMUT</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Tuan Bui, Oanh Tran, Phuong Nguyen, Bao Ho, Long Nguyen, Thang Bui, Tho Quan</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09296v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09296v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: In today&#39;s rapidly evolving landscape of Artificial Intelligence, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a vibrant research topic. LLMs find applications in various fields and contribute significantly. Despite their powerful language capabilities, similar to pre-trained language models (PLMs), LLMs still face challenges in remembering events, incorporating new information, and addressing domain-specific issues or hallucinations. To overcome these limitations, researchers have proposed Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, some others have proposed the integration of LLMs with Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to provide factual context, thereby improving performance and delivering more accurate feedback to user queries. Education plays a crucial role in human development and progress. With the technology transformation, traditional education is being replaced by digital or blended education. Therefore, educational data in the digital environment is increasing day by day. Data in higher education institutions are diverse, comprising various sources such as unstructured/structured text, relational databases, web/app-based API access, etc. Constructing a Knowledge Graph from these cross-data sources is not a simple task. This article proposes a method for automatically constructing a Knowledge Graph from multiple data sources and discusses some initial applications (experimental trials) of KG in conjunction with LLMs for question-answering tasks.</p><h4 id="emerging-platforms-meet-emerging-llms-a-year-long-journey-of-top-down-development" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#emerging-platforms-meet-emerging-llms-a-year-long-journey-of-top-down-development"><span>Emerging Platforms Meet Emerging LLMs: A Year-Long Journey of Top-Down Development</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Siyuan Feng, Jiawei Liu, Ruihang Lai, Charlie F.

However, it presents significant software engineering challenges due to the fast evolution of models, especially the recent \llmfull{s} (\llm{s}), and the emergence of new computing platforms. Current ML frameworks are primarily engineered for CPU and CUDA platforms, leaving a big gap in enabling emerging ones like Metal, Vulkan, and WebGPU. While a traditional bottom-up development pipeline fails to close the gap timely, we introduce TapML, a top-down approach and tooling designed to streamline the deployment of ML systems on diverse platforms, optimized for developer productivity. Unlike traditional bottom-up methods, which involve extensive manual testing and debugging, TapML automates unit testing through test carving and adopts a migration-based strategy for gradually offloading model computations from mature source platforms to emerging target platforms. By leveraging realistic inputs and remote connections for gradual target offloading, TapML accelerates the validation and minimizes debugging scopes, significantly optimizing development efforts. TapML was developed and applied through a year-long, real-world effort that successfully deployed significant emerging models and platforms. Through serious deployments of 82 emerging models in 17 distinct architectures across 5 emerging platforms, we showcase the effectiveness of TapML in enhancing developer productivity while ensuring model reliability and efficiency. Furthermore, we summarize comprehensive case studies from our real-world development, offering best practices for developing emerging ML systems.</p><h4 id="unveiling-llm-evaluation-focused-on-metrics-challenges-and-solutions" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#unveiling-llm-evaluation-focused-on-metrics-challenges-and-solutions"><span>Unveiling LLM Evaluation Focused on Metrics: Challenges and Solutions</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Taojun Hu, Xiao-Hua Zhou</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09135v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09135v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Natural Language Processing (NLP) is witnessing a remarkable breakthrough driven by the success of Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs have gained significant attention across academia and industry for their versatile applications in text generation, question answering, and text summarization. As the landscape of NLP evolves with an increasing number of domain-specific LLMs employing diverse techniques and trained on various corpus, evaluating performance of these models becomes paramount. To quantify the performance, it&#39;s crucial to have a comprehensive grasp of existing metrics. Among the evaluation, metrics which quantifying the performance of LLMs play a pivotal role. This paper offers a comprehensive exploration of LLM evaluation from a metrics perspective, providing insights into the selection and interpretation of metrics currently in use. Our main goal is to elucidate their mathematical formulations and statistical interpretations. We shed light on the application of these metrics using recent Biomedical LLMs. Additionally, we offer a succinct comparison of these metrics, aiding researchers in selecting appropriate metrics for diverse tasks. The overarching goal is to furnish researchers with a pragmatic guide for effective LLM evaluation and metric selection, thereby advancing the understanding and application of these large language models.</p><h4 id="confidence-calibration-and-rationalization-for-llms-via-multi-agent-deliberation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#confidence-calibration-and-rationalization-for-llms-via-multi-agent-deliberation"><span>Confidence Calibration and Rationalization for LLMs via Multi-Agent Deliberation</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Ruixin Yang, Dheeraj Rajagopa, Shirley Anugrah Hayati, Bin Hu, Dongyeop Kang</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09127v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09127v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Uncertainty estimation is a significant issue for current large language models (LLMs) that are generally poorly calibrated and over-confident, especially with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).

These tools help developers improve their coding efficiency and reduce errors by providing real-time suggestions based on the developer&#39;s codebase. While beneficial, these tools might inadvertently expose the developer&#39;s proprietary code to the code assistant service provider during the development process. In this work, we propose two complementary methods to mitigate the risk of code leakage when using LLM-based code assistants. The first is a technique for reconstructing a developer&#39;s original codebase from code segments sent to the code assistant service (i.e., prompts) during the development process, enabling assessment and evaluation of the extent of code leakage to third parties (or adversaries). The second is CodeCloak, a novel deep reinforcement learning agent that manipulates the prompts before sending them to the code assistant service. CodeCloak aims to achieve the following two contradictory goals: (i) minimizing code leakage, while (ii) preserving relevant and useful suggestions for the developer. Our evaluation, employing GitHub Copilot, StarCoder, and CodeLlama LLM-based code assistants models, demonstrates the effectiveness of our CodeCloak approach on a diverse set of code repositories of varying sizes, as well as its transferability across different models. In addition, we generate a realistic simulated coding environment to thoroughly analyze code leakage risks and evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed mitigation techniques under practical development scenarios.</p><h4 id="do-llms-play-dice-exploring-probability-distribution-sampling-in-large-language-models-for-behavioral-simulation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#do-llms-play-dice-exploring-probability-distribution-sampling-in-large-language-models-for-behavioral-simulation"><span>Do LLMs Play Dice?

The actions within this decision-making framework adhere to specific probability distributions and require iterative sampling. This arouses our curiosity regarding the capacity of LLM agents to comprehend probability distributions, thereby guiding the agent&#39;s behavioral decision-making through probabilistic sampling and generating behavioral sequences. To answer the above question, we divide the problem into two main aspects: simulation where the exact probability distribution is known, and generation of sequences where the probability distribution is ambiguous. In the first case, the agent is required to give the type and parameters of the probability distribution through the problem description, and then give the sampling sequence. However, our analysis shows that LLM agents perform poorly in this case, but the sampling success rate can be improved through programming tools. Real-world scenarios often entail unknown probability distributions. Thus, in the second case, we ask the agents to change the activity level in online social networks and analyze the frequency of actions. Ultimately, our analysis shows that LLM agents cannot sample probability distributions even using programming tools. Therefore, careful consideration is still required before directly applying LLM agents as agents to simulate human behavior.</p><h4 id="eiven-efficient-implicit-attribute-value-extraction-using-multimodal-llm" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#eiven-efficient-implicit-attribute-value-extraction-using-multimodal-llm"><span>EIVEN: Efficient Implicit Attribute Value Extraction using Multimodal LLM</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Henry Peng Zou, Gavin Heqing Yu, Ziwei Fan, Dan Bu, Han Liu, Peng Dai, Dongmei Jia, Cornelia Caragea</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08886v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08886v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: In e-commerce, accurately extracting product attribute values from multimodal data is crucial for improving user experience and operational efficiency of retailers.

However, the next token prediction training objective of decoder-only LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) is misaligned with the masked span prediction objective of current infilling-style methods, which impedes LLMs from fully leveraging pre-trained knowledge for program repair. In addition, while some LLMs are capable of locating and repairing bugs end-to-end when using the related artifacts (e.g., test cases) as input, existing methods regard them as separate tasks and ask LLMs to generate patches at fixed locations. This restriction hinders LLMs from exploring potential patches beyond the given locations. In this paper, we investigate a new approach to adapt LLMs to program repair. Our core insight is that LLM&#39;s APR capability can be greatly improved by simply aligning the output to their training objective and allowing them to refine the whole program without first performing fault localization. Based on this insight, we designed D4C, a straightforward prompting framework for APR. D4C can repair 180 bugs correctly in Defects4J, with each patch being sampled only 10 times. This surpasses the SOTA APR methods with perfect fault localization by 10% and reduces the patch sampling number by 90%. Our findings reveal that (1) objective alignment is crucial for fully exploiting LLM&#39;s pre-trained capability, and (2) replacing the traditional localize-then-repair workflow with direct debugging is more effective for LLM-based APR methods.

Particularly important is assessing their capacity to accurately retrieve information included in a given prompt. A model&#39;s ability to do this significantly influences how effectively it can utilize contextual details, thus impacting its practical efficacy and dependability in real-world applications. Our research analyzes the in-context recall performance of various LLMs using the needle-in-a-haystack method. In this approach, a factoid (the &quot;needle&quot;) is embedded within a block of filler text (the &quot;haystack&quot;), which the model is asked to retrieve. We assess the recall performance of each model across various haystack lengths and with varying needle placements to identify performance patterns. This study demonstrates that an LLM&#39;s recall capability is not only contingent upon the prompt&#39;s content but also may be compromised by biases in its training data. Conversely, adjustments to model architecture, training strategy, or fine-tuning can improve performance. Our analysis provides insight into LLM behavior, offering direction for the development of more effective applications of LLMs.</p><h2 id="_2024-04-12" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2024-04-12"><span>2024-04-12</span></a></h2><h4 id="creativeval-evaluating-creativity-of-llm-based-hardware-code-generation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#creativeval-evaluating-creativity-of-llm-based-hardware-code-generation"><span>CreativEval: Evaluating Creativity of LLM-Based Hardware Code Generation</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Matthew DeLorenzo, Vasudev Gohil, Jeyavijayan Rajendran</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08806v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08806v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Large Language Models (LLMs) have proved effective and efficient in generating code, leading to their utilization within the hardware design process.

However, training LLMs to serve as effective assistants for humans requires careful consideration. A promising approach is reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which leverages human feedback to update the model in accordance with human preferences and mitigate issues like toxicity and hallucinations. Yet, an understanding of RLHF for LLMs is largely entangled with initial design choices that popularized the method and current research focuses on augmenting those choices rather than fundamentally improving the framework. In this paper, we analyze RLHF through the lens of reinforcement learning principles to develop an understanding of its fundamentals, dedicating substantial focus to the core component of RLHF -- the reward model. Our study investigates modeling choices, caveats of function approximation, and their implications on RLHF training algorithms, highlighting the underlying assumptions made about the expressivity of reward. Our analysis improves the understanding of the role of reward models and methods for their training, concurrently revealing limitations of the current methodology. We characterize these limitations, including incorrect generalization, model misspecification, and the sparsity of feedback, along with their impact on the performance of a language model. The discussion and analysis are substantiated by a categorical review of current literature, serving as a reference for researchers and practitioners to understand the challenges of RLHF and build upon existing efforts.</p><h4 id="online-safety-analysis-for-llms-a-benchmark-an-assessment-and-a-path-forward" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#online-safety-analysis-for-llms-a-benchmark-an-assessment-and-a-path-forward"><span>Online Safety Analysis for LLMs: a Benchmark, an Assessment, and a Path Forward</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Xuan Xie, Jiayang Song, Zhehua Zhou, Yuheng Huang, Da Song, Lei Ma</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08517v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08517v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen widespread applications across numerous fields, their limited interpretability poses concerns regarding their safe operations from multiple aspects, e.g., truthfulness, robustness, and fairness. Recent research has started developing quality assurance methods for LLMs, introducing techniques such as offline detector-based or uncertainty estimation methods. However, these approaches predominantly concentrate on post-generation analysis, leaving the online safety analysis for LLMs during the generation phase an unexplored area. To bridge this gap, we conduct in this work a comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness of existing online safety analysis methods on LLMs. We begin with a pilot study that validates the feasibility of detecting unsafe outputs in the early generation process. Following this, we establish the first publicly available benchmark of online safety analysis for LLMs, including a broad spectrum of methods, models, tasks, datasets, and evaluation metrics. Utilizing this benchmark, we extensively analyze the performance of state-of-the-art online safety analysis methods on both open-source and closed-source LLMs. This analysis reveals the strengths and weaknesses of individual methods and offers valuable insights into selecting the most appropriate method based on specific application scenarios and task requirements. Furthermore, we also explore the potential of using hybridization methods, i.e., combining multiple methods to derive a collective safety conclusion, to enhance the efficacy of online safety analysis for LLMs. Our findings indicate a promising direction for the development of innovative and trustworthy quality assurance methodologies for LLMs, facilitating their reliable deployments across diverse domains.</p><h4 id="efficient-interactive-llm-serving-with-proxy-model-based-sequence-length-prediction" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#efficient-interactive-llm-serving-with-proxy-model-based-sequence-length-prediction"><span>Efficient Interactive LLM Serving with Proxy Model-based Sequence Length Prediction</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Haoran Qiu, Weichao Mao, Archit Patke, Shengkun Cui, Saurabh Jha, Chen Wang, Hubertus Franke, Zbigniew T.

In this paper, we investigate tokenization from a theoretical point of view by studying the behavior of transformers on simple data generating processes. When trained on data drawn from certain simple $k^{\text{th}}$-order Markov processes for $k &gt; 1$, transformers exhibit a surprising phenomenon - in the absence of tokenization, they empirically fail to learn the right distribution and predict characters according to a unigram model (Makkuva et al., 2024). With the addition of tokenization, however, we empirically observe that transformers break through this barrier and are able to model the probabilities of sequences drawn from the source near-optimally, achieving small cross-entropy loss. With this observation as starting point, we study the end-to-end cross-entropy loss achieved by transformers with and without tokenization. With the appropriate tokenization, we show that even the simplest unigram models (over tokens) learnt by transformers are able to model the probability of sequences drawn from $k^{\text{th}}$-order Markov sources near optimally. Our analysis provides a justification for the use of tokenization in practice through studying the behavior of transformers on Markovian data.</p><h4 id="subtoxic-questions-dive-into-attitude-change-of-llm-s-response-in-jailbreak-attempts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#subtoxic-questions-dive-into-attitude-change-of-llm-s-response-in-jailbreak-attempts"><span>Subtoxic Questions: Dive Into Attitude Change of LLM&#39;s Response in Jailbreak Attempts</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Tianyu Zhang, Zixuan Zhao, Jiaqi Huang, Jingyu Hua, Sheng Zhong</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08309v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08309v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: As Large Language Models (LLMs) of Prompt Jailbreaking are getting more and more attention, it is of great significance to raise a generalized research paradigm to evaluate attack strengths and a basic model to conduct subtler experiments.

However, when tackling complex tasks that pose significant challenges for state-of-the-art models, this technique often struggles to produce effective chains of thought that lead to correct answers. In this work, we propose a novel approach to distill reasoning abilities from LLMs by leveraging their capacity to explain solutions. We apply our method to solving competitive-level programming challenges. More specifically, we employ an LLM to generate explanations for a set of &lt;problem, solution-program&gt; pairs, then use &lt;problem, explanation&gt; pairs to fine-tune a smaller language model, which we refer to as the Reasoner, to learn algorithmic reasoning that can generate &quot;how-to-solve&quot; hints for unseen problems. Our experiments demonstrate that learning from explanations enables the Reasoner to more effectively guide program implementation by a Coder, resulting in higher solve rates than strong chain-of-thought baselines on competitive-level programming problems. It also outperforms models that learn directly from &lt;problem, solution-program&gt; pairs. We curated an additional test set in the CodeContests format, which includes 246 more recent problems posted after the models&#39; knowledge cutoff.</p><h4 id="llm-agents-can-autonomously-exploit-one-day-vulnerabilities" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#llm-agents-can-autonomously-exploit-one-day-vulnerabilities"><span>LLM Agents can Autonomously Exploit One-day Vulnerabilities</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Richard Fang, Rohan Bindu, Akul Gupta, Daniel Kang</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08144v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08144v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: LLMs have becoming increasingly powerful, both in their benign and malicious uses. With the increase in capabilities, researchers have been increasingly interested in their ability to exploit cybersecurity vulnerabilities. In particular, recent work has conducted preliminary studies on the ability of LLM agents to autonomously hack websites. However, these studies are limited to simple vulnerabilities. In this work, we show that LLM agents can autonomously exploit one-day vulnerabilities in real-world systems. To show this, we collected a dataset of 15 one-day vulnerabilities that include ones categorized as critical severity in the CVE description. When given the CVE description, GPT-4 is capable of exploiting 87% of these vulnerabilities compared to 0% for every other model we test (GPT-3.5, open-source LLMs) and open-source vulnerability scanners (ZAP and Metasploit). Fortunately, our GPT-4 agent requires the CVE description for high performance: without the description, GPT-4 can exploit only 7% of the vulnerabilities. Our findings raise questions around the widespread deployment of highly capable LLM agents.</p><h4 id="auctions-with-llm-summaries" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#auctions-with-llm-summaries"><span>Auctions with LLM Summaries</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Kumar Avinava Dubey, Zhe Feng, Rahul Kidambi, Aranyak Mehta, Di Wang</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08126v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08126v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: We study an auction setting in which bidders bid for placement of their content within a summary generated by a large language model (LLM), e.g., an ad auction in which the display is a summary paragraph of multiple ads.

The task aims to assess how well LLMs can handle non-standard dialectal varieties, as their performance on standard languages is already well-established. We propose an approach that combines the strengths of different types of language models and leverages data augmentation techniques to improve task performance on three South Slavic dialects: Chakavian, Cherkano, and Torlak. We conduct experiments using a language-family-focused encoder-based model (BERTi&#39;c) and a domain-agnostic multilingual model (AYA-101). Our results demonstrate that the proposed data augmentation techniques lead to substantial performance gains across all three test datasets in the open-source model category. This work highlights the practical utility of data augmentation and the potential of LLMs in handling non-standard dialectal varieties, contributing to the broader goal of advancing natural language understanding in low-resource and dialectal settings.

Common approaches include fine-tuning transformer based models. However, these models require a large amount of labelled data, which might not be available. In this work, we present two different ways to leverage LLM-generated synthetic data to train and improve stance detection agents for online political discussions: first, we show that augmenting a small fine-tuning dataset with synthetic data can improve the performance of the stance detection model. Second, we propose a new active learning method called SQBC based on the &quot;Query-by-Comittee&quot; approach. The key idea is to use LLM-generated synthetic data as an oracle to identify the most informative unlabelled samples, that are selected for manual labelling. Comprehensive experiments show that both ideas can improve the stance detection performance. Curiously, we observed that fine-tuning on actively selected samples can exceed the performance of using the full dataset.</p><h4 id="leveraging-large-language-models-llms-to-support-collaborative-human-ai-online-risk-data-annotation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#leveraging-large-language-models-llms-to-support-collaborative-human-ai-online-risk-data-annotation"><span>Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to Support Collaborative Human-AI Online Risk Data Annotation</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Jinkyung Park, Pamela Wisniewski, Vivek Singh</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07926v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07926v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: In this position paper, we discuss the potential for leveraging LLMs as interactive research tools to facilitate collaboration between human coders and AI to effectively annotate online risk data at scale. Collaborative human-AI labeling is a promising approach to annotating large-scale and complex data for various tasks. Yet, tools and methods to support effective human-AI collaboration for data annotation are under-studied. This gap is pertinent because co-labeling tasks need to support a two-way interactive discussion that can add nuance and context, particularly in the context of online risk, which is highly subjective and contextualized. Therefore, we provide some of the early benefits and challenges of using LLMs-based tools for risk annotation and suggest future directions for the HCI research community to leverage LLMs as research tools to facilitate human-AI collaboration in contextualized online data annotation. Our research interests align very well with the purposes of the LLMs as Research Tools workshop to identify ongoing applications and challenges of using LLMs to work with data in HCI research.

Despite significant strides toward safety alignment, recent work GCG~\citep{zou2023universal} proposes a discrete token optimization algorithm and selects the single suffix with the lowest loss to successfully jailbreak aligned LLMs. In this work, we first discuss the drawbacks of solely picking the suffix with the lowest loss during GCG optimization for jailbreaking and uncover the missed successful suffixes during the intermediate steps. Moreover, we utilize those successful suffixes as training data to learn a generative model, named AmpleGCG, which captures the distribution of adversarial suffixes given a harmful query and enables the rapid generation of hundreds of suffixes for any harmful queries in seconds. AmpleGCG achieves near 100% attack success rate (ASR) on two aligned LLMs (Llama-2-7B-chat and Vicuna-7B), surpassing two strongest attack baselines. More interestingly, AmpleGCG also transfers seamlessly to attack different models, including closed-source LLMs, achieving a 99% ASR on the latest GPT-3.5. To summarize, our work amplifies the impact of GCG by training a generative model of adversarial suffixes that is universal to any harmful queries and transferable from attacking open-source LLMs to closed-source LLMs. In addition, it can generate 200 adversarial suffixes for one harmful query in only 4 seconds, rendering it more challenging to defend.</p><h4 id="oda-observation-driven-agent-for-integrating-llms-and-knowledge-graphs" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#oda-observation-driven-agent-for-integrating-llms-and-knowledge-graphs"><span>ODA: Observation-Driven Agent for integrating LLMs and Knowledge Graphs</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Lei Sun, Zhengwei Tao, Youdi Li, Hiroshi Arakawa</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07677v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07677v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) and knowledge graphs (KGs) has achieved remarkable success in various natural language processing tasks.

Thus, a number of large language models (LLMs) have recently been adapted to the medical domain, so that they can be used as a tool for mediating in human-AI interaction. While these LLMs display competitive performance on automated medical texts benchmarks, they have been pre-trained and evaluated with a focus on a single language (English mostly). This is particularly true of text-to-text models, which typically require large amounts of domain-specific pre-training data, often not easily accessible for many languages. In this paper, we address these shortcomings by compiling, to the best of our knowledge, the largest multilingual corpus for the medical domain in four languages, namely English, French, Italian and Spanish. This new corpus has been used to train Medical mT5, the first open-source text-to-text multilingual model for the medical domain. Additionally, we present two new evaluation benchmarks for all four languages with the aim of facilitating multilingual research in this domain. A comprehensive evaluation shows that Medical mT5 outperforms both encoders and similarly sized text-to-text models for the Spanish, French, and Italian benchmarks, while being competitive with current state-of-the-art LLMs in English.</p><h4 id="ultraeval-a-lightweight-platform-for-flexible-and-comprehensive-evaluation-for-llms" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ultraeval-a-lightweight-platform-for-flexible-and-comprehensive-evaluation-for-llms"><span>UltraEval: A Lightweight Platform for Flexible and Comprehensive Evaluation for LLMs</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Chaoqun He, Renjie Luo, Shengding Hu, Yuanqian Zhao, Jie Zhou, Hanghao Wu, Jiajie Zhang, Xu Han, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07584v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07584v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Evaluation is pivotal for honing Large Language Models (LLMs), pinpointing their capabilities and guiding enhancements. The rapid development of LLMs calls for a lightweight and easy-to-use framework for swift evaluation deployment. However, due to the various implementation details to consider, developing a comprehensive evaluation platform is never easy. Existing platforms are often complex and poorly modularized, hindering seamless incorporation into researcher&#39;s workflows. This paper introduces UltraEval, a user-friendly evaluation framework characterized by lightweight, comprehensiveness, modularity, and efficiency. We identify and reimplement three core components of model evaluation (models, data, and metrics). The resulting composability allows for the free combination of different models, tasks, prompts, and metrics within a unified evaluation workflow. Additionally, UltraEval supports diverse models owing to a unified HTTP service and provides sufficient inference acceleration. UltraEval is now available for researchers publicly~\footnote{Website is at \url{https://github.com/OpenBMB/UltraEval}}.</p><h4 id="decomposing-label-space-format-and-discrimination-rethinking-how-llms-respond-and-solve-tasks-via-in-context-learning" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#decomposing-label-space-format-and-discrimination-rethinking-how-llms-respond-and-solve-tasks-via-in-context-learning"><span>Decomposing Label Space, Format and Discrimination: Rethinking How LLMs Respond and Solve Tasks via In-Context Learning</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Quanyu Long, Yin Wu, Wenya Wang, Sinno Jialin Pan</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07546v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07546v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: In-context Learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful capability alongside the development of scaled-up large language models (LLMs). By instructing LLMs using few-shot demonstrative examples, ICL enables them to perform a wide range of tasks without updating millions of parameters. However, the precise contributions of demonstrations towards improving end-task performance have not been thoroughly investigated in recent analytical studies. In this paper, we empirically decompose the overall performance of ICL into three dimensions, label space, format, and discrimination, and we evaluate four general-purpose LLMs across a diverse range of tasks. Counter-intuitively, we find that the demonstrations have a marginal impact on provoking discriminative knowledge of language models. However, ICL exhibits significant efficacy in regulating the label space and format which helps LLMs to respond in desired label words. We then demonstrate this ability functions similar to detailed instructions for LLMs to follow. We additionally provide an in-depth analysis of the mechanism of retrieval helping with ICL and find that retrieving the most semantically similar examples notably boosts model&#39;s discriminative capability.</p><h4 id="wese-weak-exploration-to-strong-exploitation-for-llm-agents" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#wese-weak-exploration-to-strong-exploitation-for-llm-agents"><span>WESE: Weak Exploration to Strong Exploitation for LLM Agents</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Xu Huang, Weiwen Liu, Xiaolong Chen, Xingmei Wang, Defu Lian, Yasheng Wang, Ruiming Tang, Enhong Chen</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07456v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07456v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential as an intelligent agent. However, existing researches mainly focus on enhancing the agent&#39;s reasoning or decision-making abilities through well-designed prompt engineering or task-specific fine-tuning, ignoring the procedure of exploration and exploitation. When addressing complex tasks within open-world interactive environments, these methods exhibit limitations. Firstly, the lack of global information of environments leads to greedy decisions, resulting in sub-optimal solutions. On the other hand, irrelevant information acquired from the environment not only adversely introduces noise, but also incurs additional cost. This paper proposes a novel approach, Weak Exploration to Strong Exploitation (WESE), to enhance LLM agents in solving open-world interactive tasks. Concretely, WESE involves decoupling the exploration and exploitation process, employing a cost-effective weak agent to perform exploration tasks for global knowledge. A knowledge graph-based strategy is then introduced to store the acquired knowledge and extract task-relevant knowledge, enhancing the stronger agent in success rate and efficiency for the exploitation task. Our approach is flexible enough to incorporate diverse tasks, and obtains significant improvements in both success rates and efficiency across four interactive benchmarks.</p><h4 id="learning-to-localize-objects-improves-spatial-reasoning-in-visual-llms" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#learning-to-localize-objects-improves-spatial-reasoning-in-visual-llms"><span>Learning to Localize Objects Improves Spatial Reasoning in Visual-LLMs</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Kanchana Ranasinghe, Satya Narayan Shukla, Omid Poursaeed, Michael S.

However, existing V-LLMs (e.g. BLIP-2, LLaVA) demonstrate weak spatial reasoning and localization awareness. Despite generating highly descriptive and elaborate textual answers, these models fail at simple tasks like distinguishing a left vs right location. In this work, we explore how image-space coordinate based instruction fine-tuning objectives could inject spatial awareness into V-LLMs. We discover optimal coordinate representations, data-efficient instruction fine-tuning objectives, and pseudo-data generation strategies that lead to improved spatial awareness in V-LLMs. Additionally, our resulting model improves VQA across image and video domains, reduces undesired hallucination, and generates better contextual object descriptions. Experiments across 5 vision-language tasks involving 14 different datasets establish the clear performance improvements achieved by our proposed framework.</p><h2 id="_2024-04-10" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2024-04-10"><span>2024-04-10</span></a></h2><h4 id="biscuit-scaffolding-llm-generated-code-with-ephemeral-uis-in-computational-notebooks" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#biscuit-scaffolding-llm-generated-code-with-ephemeral-uis-in-computational-notebooks"><span>BISCUIT: Scaffolding LLM-Generated Code with Ephemeral UIs in Computational Notebooks</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Ruijia Cheng, Titus Barik, Alan Leung, Fred Hohman, Jeffrey Nichols</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07387v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07387v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Novices frequently engage with machine learning tutorials in computational notebooks and have been adopting code generation technologies based on large language models (LLMs). However, they encounter difficulties in understanding and working with code produced by LLMs. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce a novel workflow into computational notebooks that augments LLM-based code generation with an additional ephemeral UI step, offering users UI-based scaffolds as an intermediate stage between user prompts and code generation. We present this workflow in BISCUIT, an extension for JupyterLab that provides users with ephemeral UIs generated by LLMs based on the context of their code and intentions, scaffolding users to understand, guide, and explore with LLM-generated code. Through 10 user studies where novices used BISCUIT for machine learning tutorials, we discover that BISCUIT offers user semantic representation of code to aid their understanding, reduces the complexity of prompt engineering, and creates a playground for users to explore different variables and iterate on their ideas.

The current model, while trained solely on successful proof paths, faces a discrepancy at the inference stage, as it must sample and try various tactics at each proof state until finding success, unlike its training which does not incorporate learning from failed attempts. Intuitively, a tactic that leads to a failed search path would indicate that similar tactics should receive less attention during the following trials. In this paper, we demonstrate the benefit of training models that additionally learn from failed search paths. Facing the lack of such trial-and-error data in existing open-source theorem-proving datasets, we curate a dataset on intuitionistic propositional logic theorems and formalize it in Lean, such that we can reliably check the correctness of proofs. We compare our model trained on relatively short trial-and-error information (TrialMaster) with models trained only on the correct paths and discover that the former solves more unseen theorems with lower trial searches.</p><h4 id="llms-in-biomedicine-a-study-on-clinical-named-entity-recognition" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#llms-in-biomedicine-a-study-on-clinical-named-entity-recognition"><span>LLMs in Biomedicine: A study on clinical Named Entity Recognition</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Masoud Monajatipoor, Jiaxin Yang, Joel Stremmel, Melika Emami, Fazlolah Mohaghegh, Mozhdeh Rouhsedaghat, Kai-Wei Chang</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07376v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07376v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable versatility in various NLP tasks but encounter distinct challenges in biomedicine due to medical language complexities and data scarcity.

Conventional evaluation methods, typically designed primarily for LLM development, yield numerical scores that ignore the user experience. Therefore, our study shifts the focus from model-centered to human-centered evaluation in the context of AI-powered writing assistance applications. Our proposed metric, termed <code>Revision Distance,&#39;&#39; utilizes LLMs to suggest revision edits that mimic the human writing process. It is determined by counting the revision edits generated by LLMs. Benefiting from the generated revision edit details, our metric can provide a self-explained text evaluation result in a human-understandable manner beyond the context-independent score.

Today, humans verify the correctness and appropriateness of the LLM-generated outputs (e.g., code, functions, or actions) before putting them into real-world execution. This poses significant challenges as code comprehension is well known to be notoriously difficult. In this paper, we study how humans can efficiently collaborate with, delegate to, and supervise autonomous LLMs in the future. We argue that in many cases, &quot;post-facto validation&quot; - verifying the correctness of a proposed action after seeing the output - is much easier than the aforementioned &quot;pre-facto validation&quot; setting. The core concept behind enabling a post-facto validation system is the integration of an intuitive undo feature, and establishing a damage confinement for the LLM-generated actions as effective strategies to mitigate the associated risks. Using this, a human can now either revert the effect of an LLM-generated output or be confident that the potential risk is bounded. We believe this is critical to unlock the potential for LLM agents to interact with applications and services with limited (post-facto) human involvement. We describe the design and implementation of our open-source runtime for executing LLM actions, Gorilla Execution Engine (GoEX), and present open research questions towards realizing the goal of LLMs and applications interacting with each other with minimal human supervision. We release GoEX at https://github.com/ShishirPatil/gorilla/.</p><h4 id="simpler-becomes-harder-do-llms-exhibit-a-coherent-behavior-on-simplified-corpora" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#simpler-becomes-harder-do-llms-exhibit-a-coherent-behavior-on-simplified-corpora"><span>Simpler becomes Harder: Do LLMs Exhibit a Coherent Behavior on Simplified Corpora?</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Miriam Anschütz, Edoardo Mosca, Georg Groh</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06838v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06838v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Text simplification seeks to improve readability while retaining the original content and meaning.

Our work aims to bridge this gap by delving into the Food domain, a universally relevant yet culturally diverse aspect of human life. We introduce FmLAMA, a multilingual dataset centered on food-related cultural facts and variations in food practices. We analyze LLMs across various architectures and configurations, evaluating their performance in both monolingual and multilingual settings. By leveraging templates in six different languages, we investigate how LLMs interact with language-specific and cultural knowledge. Our findings reveal that (1) LLMs demonstrate a pronounced bias towards food knowledge prevalent in the United States; (2) Incorporating relevant cultural context significantly improves LLMs&#39; ability to access cultural knowledge; (3) The efficacy of LLMs in capturing cultural nuances is highly dependent on the interplay between the probing language, the specific model architecture, and the cultural context in question. This research underscores the complexity of integrating cultural understanding into LLMs and emphasizes the importance of culturally diverse datasets to mitigate biases and enhance model performance across different cultural domains.</p><h4 id="not-all-contexts-are-equal-teaching-llms-credibility-aware-generation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#not-all-contexts-are-equal-teaching-llms-credibility-aware-generation"><span>Not All Contexts Are Equal: Teaching LLMs Credibility-aware Generation</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Ruotong Pan, Boxi Cao, Hongyu Lin, Xianpei Han, Jia Zheng, Sirui Wang, Xunliang Cai, Le Sun</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06809v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06809v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: The rapid development of large language models has led to the widespread adoption of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which integrates external knowledge to alleviate knowledge bottlenecks and mitigate hallucinations. However, the existing RAG paradigm inevitably suffers from the impact of flawed information introduced during the retrieval phrase, thereby diminishing the reliability and correctness of the generated outcomes. In this paper, we propose Credibility-aware Generation (CAG), a universally applicable framework designed to mitigate the impact of flawed information in RAG. At its core, CAG aims to equip models with the ability to discern and process information based on its credibility. To this end, we propose an innovative data transformation framework that generates data based on credibility, thereby effectively endowing models with the capability of CAG. Furthermore, to accurately evaluate the models&#39; capabilities of CAG, we construct a comprehensive benchmark covering three critical real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our model can effectively understand and utilize credibility for generation, significantly outperform other models with retrieval augmentation, and exhibit resilience against the disruption caused by noisy documents, thereby maintaining robust performance. Moreover, our model supports customized credibility, offering a wide range of potential applications.</p><h4 id="mathvc-an-llm-simulated-multi-character-virtual-classroom-for-mathematics-education" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#mathvc-an-llm-simulated-multi-character-virtual-classroom-for-mathematics-education"><span>MathVC: An LLM-Simulated Multi-Character Virtual Classroom for Mathematics Education</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Murong Yue, Wijdane Mifdal, Yixuan Zhang, Jennifer Suh, Ziyu Yao</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06711v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06711v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Mathematical modeling (MM) is considered a fundamental skill for students in STEM disciplines. Practicing the MM skill is often the most effective when students can engage in group discussion and collaborative problem-solving. However, due to unevenly distributed teachers and educational resources needed to monitor such group activities, students do not always receive equal opportunities for this practice. Excitingly, large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong capability in both modeling mathematical problems and simulating characters with different traits and properties. Drawing inspiration from the advancement of LLMs, in this work, we present MATHVC, the very first LLM-powered virtual classroom containing multiple LLM-simulated student characters, with whom a human student can practice their MM skill. To encourage each LLM character&#39;s behaviors to be aligned with their specified math-relevant properties (termed &quot;characteristics alignment&quot;) and the overall conversational procedure to be close to an authentic student MM discussion (termed &quot;conversational procedural alignment&quot;), we proposed three innovations: integrating MM domain knowledge into the simulation, defining a symbolic schema as the ground for character simulation, and designing a meta planner at the platform level to drive the conversational procedure. Through experiments and ablation studies, we confirmed the effectiveness of our simulation approach and showed the promise for MATHVC to benefit real-life students in the future.</p><h4 id="culturalteaming-ai-assisted-interactive-red-teaming-for-challenging-llms-lack-of-multicultural-knowledge" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#culturalteaming-ai-assisted-interactive-red-teaming-for-challenging-llms-lack-of-multicultural-knowledge"><span>CulturalTeaming: AI-Assisted Interactive Red-Teaming for Challenging LLMs&#39; (Lack of) Multicultural Knowledge</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Yu Ying Chiu, Liwei Jiang, Maria Antoniak, Chan Young Park, Shuyue Stella Li, Mehar Bhatia, Sahithya Ravi, Yulia Tsvetkov, Vered Shwartz, Yejin Choi</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06664v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06664v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Frontier large language models (LLMs) are developed by researchers and practitioners with skewed cultural backgrounds and on datasets with skewed sources. However, LLMs&#39; (lack of) multicultural knowledge cannot be effectively assessed with current methods for developing benchmarks. Existing multicultural evaluations primarily rely on expensive and restricted human annotations or potentially outdated internet resources. Thus, they struggle to capture the intricacy, dynamics, and diversity of cultural norms. LLM-generated benchmarks are promising, yet risk propagating the same biases they are meant to measure. To synergize the creativity and expert cultural knowledge of human annotators and the scalability and standardizability of LLM-based automation, we introduce CulturalTeaming, an interactive red-teaming system that leverages human-AI collaboration to build truly challenging evaluation dataset for assessing the multicultural knowledge of LLMs, while improving annotators&#39; capabilities and experiences. Our study reveals that CulturalTeaming&#39;s various modes of AI assistance support annotators in creating cultural questions, that modern LLMs fail at, in a gamified manner. Importantly, the increased level of AI assistance (e.g., LLM-generated revision hints) empowers users to create more difficult questions with enhanced perceived creativity of themselves, shedding light on the promises of involving heavier AI assistance in modern evaluation dataset creation procedures. Through a series of 1-hour workshop sessions, we gather CULTURALBENCH-V0.1, a compact yet high-quality evaluation dataset with users&#39; red-teaming attempts, that different families of modern LLMs perform with accuracy ranging from 37.7% to 72.2%, revealing a notable gap in LLMs&#39; multicultural proficiency.</p><h2 id="_2024-04-09" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2024-04-09"><span>2024-04-09</span></a></h2><h4 id="khayyam-challenge-persianmmlu-is-your-llm-truly-wise-to-the-persian-language" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#khayyam-challenge-persianmmlu-is-your-llm-truly-wise-to-the-persian-language"><span>Khayyam Challenge (PersianMMLU): Is Your LLM Truly Wise to The Persian Language?</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Omid Ghahroodi, Marzia Nouri, Mohammad Vali Sanian, Alireza Sahebi, Doratossadat Dastgheib, Ehsaneddin Asgari, Mahdieh Soleymani Baghshah, Mohammad Hossein Rohban</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06644v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06644v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) is challenging due to their generative nature, necessitating precise evaluation methodologies.

These include aligning LLMs&#39; responses with human values to prevent harmful outputs, which is addressed through safety training methods. Even so, bad actors and malicious users have succeeded in attempts to manipulate the LLMs to generate misaligned responses for harmful questions such as methods to create a bomb in school labs, recipes for harmful drugs, and ways to evade privacy rights. Another challenge is the multilingual capabilities of LLMs, which enable the model to understand and respond in multiple languages. Consequently, attackers exploit the unbalanced pre-training datasets of LLMs in different languages and the comparatively lower model performance in low-resource languages than high-resource ones. As a result, attackers use a low-resource languages to intentionally manipulate the model to create harmful responses. Many of the similar attack vectors have been patched by model providers, making the LLMs more robust against language-based manipulation. In this paper, we introduce a new black-box attack vector called the \emph{Sandwich attack}: a multi-language mixture attack, which manipulates state-of-the-art LLMs into generating harmful and misaligned responses. Our experiments with five different models, namely Google&#39;s Bard, Gemini Pro, LLaMA-2-70-B-Chat, GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4, and Claude-3-OPUS, show that this attack vector can be used by adversaries to generate harmful responses and elicit misaligned responses from these models. By detailing both the mechanism and impact of the Sandwich attack, this paper aims to guide future research and development towards more secure and resilient LLMs, ensuring they serve the public good while minimizing potential for misuse.</p><h4 id="comparing-two-model-designs-for-clinical-note-generation-is-an-llm-a-useful-evaluator-of-consistency" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#comparing-two-model-designs-for-clinical-note-generation-is-an-llm-a-useful-evaluator-of-consistency"><span>Comparing Two Model Designs for Clinical Note Generation; Is an LLM a Useful Evaluator of Consistency?</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Nathan Brake, Thomas Schaaf</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06503v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06503v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Following an interaction with a patient, physicians are responsible for the submission of clinical documentation, often organized as a SOAP note. A clinical note is not simply a summary of the conversation but requires the use of appropriate medical terminology. The relevant information can then be extracted and organized according to the structure of the SOAP note. In this paper we analyze two different approaches to generate the different sections of a SOAP note based on the audio recording of the conversation, and specifically examine them in terms of note consistency. The first approach generates the sections independently, while the second method generates them all together. In this work we make use of PEGASUS-X Transformer models and observe that both methods lead to similar ROUGE values (less than 1% difference) and have no difference in terms of the Factuality metric. We perform a human evaluation to measure aspects of consistency and demonstrate that LLMs like Llama2 can be used to perform the same tasks with roughly the same agreement as the human annotators. Between the Llama2 analysis and the human reviewers we observe a Cohen Kappa inter-rater reliability of 0.79, 1.00, and 0.32 for consistency of age, gender, and body part injury, respectively. With this we demonstrate the usefulness of leveraging an LLM to measure quality indicators that can be identified by humans but are not currently captured by automatic metrics. This allows scaling evaluation to larger data sets, and we find that clinical note consistency improves by generating each new section conditioned on the output of all previously generated sections.</p><h4 id="pitfalls-of-conversational-llms-on-news-debiasing" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#pitfalls-of-conversational-llms-on-news-debiasing"><span>Pitfalls of Conversational LLMs on News Debiasing</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Ipek Baris Schlicht, Defne Altiok, Maryanne Taouk, Lucie Flek</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06488v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06488v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: This paper addresses debiasing in news editing and evaluates the effectiveness of conversational Large Language Models in this task.

As various long-text techniques and model architectures emerge, the precise and detailed evaluation of models&#39; long-text capabilities has become increasingly important. Existing long-text evaluation benchmarks, such as L-Eval and LongBench, construct long-text test sets based on open-source datasets, focusing mainly on QA and summarization tasks. These datasets include test samples of varying lengths (from 2k to 32k+) entangled together, making it challenging to assess model capabilities across different length ranges. Moreover, they do not cover the ultralong settings (100k+ tokens) that the latest LLMs claim to achieve. In this paper, we introduce Ada-LEval, a length-adaptable benchmark for evaluating the long-context understanding of LLMs. Ada-LEval includes two challenging subsets, TSort and BestAnswer, which enable a more reliable evaluation of LLMs&#39; long context capabilities. These benchmarks support intricate manipulation of the length of test cases, and can easily produce text samples up to 128k tokens. We evaluate 4 state-of-the-art closed-source API models and 6 open-source models with Ada-LEval. The evaluation results demonstrate the limitations of current LLMs, especially in ultra-long-context settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/open-compass/Ada-LEval.</p><h4 id="agentquest-a-modular-benchmark-framework-to-measure-progress-and-improve-llm-agents" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#agentquest-a-modular-benchmark-framework-to-measure-progress-and-improve-llm-agents"><span>AgentQuest: A Modular Benchmark Framework to Measure Progress and Improve LLM Agents</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Luca Gioacchini, Giuseppe Siracusano, Davide Sanvito, Kiril Gashteovski, David Friede, Roberto Bifulco, Carolin Lawrence</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06411v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06411v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: The advances made by Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to the pursuit of LLM agents that can solve intricate, multi-step reasoning tasks.

However, creating models from requirements involves manual effort. The advent of generative large language models (LLMs), ChatGPT being a notable example, offers promising avenues for automated assistance in model generation. This paper investigates the capability of ChatGPT to generate a specific type of model, i.e., UML sequence diagrams, from NL requirements. We conduct a qualitative study in which we examine the sequence diagrams generated by ChatGPT for 28 requirements documents of various types and from different domains. Observations from the analysis of the generated diagrams have systematically been captured through evaluation logs, and categorized through thematic analysis. Our results indicate that, although the models generally conform to the standard and exhibit a reasonable level of understandability, their completeness and correctness with respect to the specified requirements often present challenges. This issue is particularly pronounced in the presence of requirements smells, such as ambiguity and inconsistency. The insights derived from this study can influence the practical utilization of LLMs in the RE process, and open the door to novel RE-specific prompting strategies targeting effective model generation.</p><h4 id="llms-reading-comprehension-is-affected-by-parametric-knowledge-and-struggles-with-hypothetical-statements" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#llms-reading-comprehension-is-affected-by-parametric-knowledge-and-struggles-with-hypothetical-statements"><span>LLMs&#39; Reading Comprehension Is Affected by Parametric Knowledge and Struggles with Hypothetical Statements</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Victoria Basmov, Yoav Goldberg, Reut Tsarfaty</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06283v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06283v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: The task of reading comprehension (RC), often implemented as context-based question answering (QA), provides a primary means to assess language models&#39; natural language understanding (NLU) capabilities. Yet, when applied to large language models (LLMs) with extensive built-in world knowledge, this method can be deceptive. If the context aligns with the LLMs&#39; internal knowledge, it is hard to discern whether the models&#39; answers stem from context comprehension or from LLMs&#39; internal information. Conversely, using data that conflicts with the models&#39; knowledge creates erroneous trends which distort the results. To address this issue, we suggest to use RC on imaginary data, based on fictitious facts and entities. This task is entirely independent of the models&#39; world knowledge, enabling us to evaluate LLMs&#39; linguistic abilities without the interference of parametric knowledge. Testing ChatGPT, GPT-4, LLaMA 2 and Mixtral on such imaginary data, we uncover a class of linguistic phenomena posing a challenge to current LLMs, involving thinking in terms of alternative, hypothetical scenarios. While all the models handle simple affirmative and negative contexts with high accuracy, they are much more prone to error when dealing with modal and conditional contexts. Crucially, these phenomena also trigger the LLMs&#39; vulnerability to knowledge-conflicts again. In particular, while some models prove virtually unaffected by knowledge conflicts in affirmative and negative contexts, when faced with more semantically involved modal and conditional environments, they often fail to separate the text from their internal knowledge.</p><h4 id="a-rag-method-for-source-code-inquiry-tailored-to-long-context-llms" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#a-rag-method-for-source-code-inquiry-tailored-to-long-context-llms"><span>A RAG Method for Source Code Inquiry Tailored to Long-Context LLMs</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Toshihiro Kamiya</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06082v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06082v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Although the context length limitation of large language models (LLMs) has been mitigated, it still hinders their application to software development tasks.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of the dataset, we instruction-tune multiple LLM-based safety models. We show that our models (named AEGISSAFETYEXPERTS), not only surpass or perform competitively with the state-of-the-art LLM-based safety models and general purpose LLMs, but also exhibit robustness across multiple jail-break attack categories. We also show how using AEGISSAFETYDATASET during the LLM alignment phase does not negatively impact the performance of the aligned models on MT Bench scores.

In this paper, we introduce \bench{}, a multimodal benchmark designed to assess the capabilities of MLLMs across a variety of web tasks. \bench{} consists of seven tasks, and comprises 1.5K human-curated instances from 139 real websites, covering 87 sub-domains. We evaluate 14 open-source MLLMs, Gemini Pro, Claude-3 series, and GPT-4V(ision) on \bench{}, revealing significant challenges and performance gaps. Further analysis highlights the limitations of current MLLMs, including inadequate grounding in text-rich environments and subpar performance with low-resolution image inputs.

In this paper, we present Ferret-UI, a new MLLM tailored for enhanced understanding of mobile UI screens, equipped with referring, grounding, and reasoning capabilities. Given that UI screens typically exhibit a more elongated aspect ratio and contain smaller objects of interest (e.g., icons, texts) than natural images, we incorporate &quot;any resolution&quot; on top of Ferret to magnify details and leverage enhanced visual features. Specifically, each screen is divided into 2 sub-images based on the original aspect ratio (i.e., horizontal division for portrait screens and vertical division for landscape screens). Both sub-images are encoded separately before being sent to LLMs. We meticulously gather training samples from an extensive range of elementary UI tasks, such as icon recognition, find text, and widget listing. These samples are formatted for instruction-following with region annotations to facilitate precise referring and grounding. To augment the model&#39;s reasoning ability, we further compile a dataset for advanced tasks, including detailed description, perception/interaction conversations, and function inference. After training on the curated datasets, Ferret-UI exhibits outstanding comprehension of UI screens and the capability to execute open-ended instructions. For model evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark encompassing all the aforementioned tasks. Ferret-UI excels not only beyond most open-source UI MLLMs, but also surpasses GPT-4V on all the elementary UI tasks.</p><h4 id="moma-multimodal-llm-adapter-for-fast-personalized-image-generation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#moma-multimodal-llm-adapter-for-fast-personalized-image-generation"><span>MoMA: Multimodal LLM Adapter for Fast Personalized Image Generation</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Kunpeng Song, Yizhe Zhu, Bingchen Liu, Qing Yan, Ahmed Elgammal, Xiao Yang</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05674v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05674v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: In this paper, we present MoMA: an open-vocabulary, training-free personalized image model that boasts flexible zero-shot capabilities. As foundational text-to-image models rapidly evolve, the demand for robust image-to-image translation grows. Addressing this need, MoMA specializes in subject-driven personalized image generation. Utilizing an open-source, Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM), we train MoMA to serve a dual role as both a feature extractor and a generator. This approach effectively synergizes reference image and text prompt information to produce valuable image features, facilitating an image diffusion model. To better leverage the generated features, we further introduce a novel self-attention shortcut method that efficiently transfers image features to an image diffusion model, improving the resemblance of the target object in generated images. Remarkably, as a tuning-free plug-and-play module, our model requires only a single reference image and outperforms existing methods in generating images with high detail fidelity, enhanced identity-preservation and prompt faithfulness.

Considering the ever-increasing context window of these models, a critical question arises: what and how many facts should be included in prompts to maximise the chance of correctly fixing bugs? To answer this question, we conducted a large-scale study, employing over 19K prompts featuring various combinations of seven diverse facts to rectify 314 bugs from open-source Python projects within the BugsInPy benchmark. Our findings revealed that each fact, ranging from simple syntactic details like code context to semantic information previously unexplored in the context of LLMs such as angelic values, is beneficial. Specifically, each fact aids in fixing some bugs that would remain unresolved or only be fixed with a low success rate without it. Importantly, we discovered that the effectiveness of program repair prompts is non-monotonic over the number of used facts; using too many facts leads to subpar outcomes. These insights led us to define the fact selection problem: determining the optimal set of facts for inclusion in a prompt to maximise LLM&#39;s performance on a given task instance. We found that there is no one-size-fits-all set of facts for bug repair. Therefore, we developed a basic statistical model, named Maniple, which selects facts specific to a given bug to include in the prompt. This model significantly surpasses the performance of the best generic fact set. To underscore the significance of the fact selection problem, we benchmarked Maniple against the state-of-the-art zero-shot, non-conversational LLM-based bug repair methods. On our testing dataset of 157 bugs, Maniple repairs 88 bugs, 17% above the best configuration.</p><h4 id="petkaz-at-semeval-2024-task-3-advancing-emotion-classification-with-an-llm-for-emotion-cause-pair-extraction-in-conversations" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#petkaz-at-semeval-2024-task-3-advancing-emotion-classification-with-an-llm-for-emotion-cause-pair-extraction-in-conversations"><span>PetKaz at SemEval-2024 Task 3: Advancing Emotion Classification with an LLM for Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction in Conversations</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Roman Kazakov, Kseniia Petukhova, Ekaterina Kochmar</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05502v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05502v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: In this paper, we present our submission to the SemEval-2023 Task~3 &quot;The Competition of Multimodal Emotion Cause Analysis in Conversations&quot;, focusing on extracting emotion-cause pairs from dialogs.

When applying LLMs to a specific scientific field, it&#39;s challenging to acquire unique domain knowledge while keeping the model itself advanced. To address this challenge, a sophisticated large language model system named as Xiwu has been developed, allowing you switch between the most advanced foundation models and quickly teach the model domain knowledge. In this work, we will report on the best practices for applying LLMs in the field of high-energy physics (HEP), including: a seed fission technology is proposed and some data collection and cleaning tools are developed to quickly obtain domain AI-Ready dataset; a just-in-time learning system is implemented based on the vector store technology; an on-the-fly fine-tuning system has been developed to facilitate rapid training under a specified foundation model. The results show that Xiwu can smoothly switch between foundation models such as LLaMA, Vicuna, ChatGLM and Grok-1. The trained Xiwu model is significantly outperformed the benchmark model on the HEP knowledge question-and-answering and code generation. This strategy significantly enhances the potential for growth of our model&#39;s performance, with the hope of surpassing GPT-4 as it evolves with the development of open-source models.

Despite the flux of research on developing advanced reasoning approaches, systematically analyzing the diverse LLMs and reasoning strategies in generating reasoning chains remains a significant challenge. The difficulties stem from the lack of two key elements: (1) an automatic method for evaluating the generated reasoning chains on different tasks, and (2) a unified formalism and implementation of the diverse reasoning approaches for systematic comparison. This paper aims to close the gap: (1) We introduce AutoRace for fully automated reasoning chain evaluation. Existing metrics rely on expensive human annotations or pre-defined LLM prompts not adaptable to different tasks. In contrast, AutoRace automatically creates detailed evaluation criteria tailored for each task, and uses GPT-4 for accurate evaluation following the criteria. (2) We develop LLM Reasoners, a library for standardized modular implementation of existing and new reasoning algorithms, under a unified formulation of the search, reward, and world model components. With the new evaluation and library, (3) we conduct extensive study of different reasoning approaches (e.g., CoT, ToT, RAP). The analysis reveals interesting findings about different factors contributing to reasoning, including the reward-guidance, breadth-vs-depth in search, world model, and prompt formats, etc.</p><h4 id="evaluation-of-an-llm-in-identifying-logical-fallacies-a-call-for-rigor-when-adopting-llms-in-hci-research" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#evaluation-of-an-llm-in-identifying-logical-fallacies-a-call-for-rigor-when-adopting-llms-in-hci-research"><span>Evaluation of an LLM in Identifying Logical Fallacies: A Call for Rigor When Adopting LLMs in HCI Research</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Gionnieve Lim, Simon T.

Accordingly, we present the evaluation of an LLM in identifying logical fallacies that will form part of a digital misinformation intervention. By comparing to a labeled dataset, we found that GPT-4 achieves an accuracy of 0.79, and for our intended use case that excludes invalid or unidentified instances, an accuracy of 0.90.

(1) Insufficient training data and unstable data quality. Collecting sufficient defective sample is expensive and time-costing, consequently leading to dataset variance. It introduces the difficulty on recognition and learning. (2) Over-dependence on visual modality. When the image pattern and texture is monotonic for all defect classes in a given dataset, the performance of conventional AOI system cannot be guaranteed. In scenarios where image quality is compromised due to mechanical failures or when defect information is inherently difficult to discern, the performance of deep models cannot be guaranteed. A main question is, &quot;how to solve those two problems when they occur at the same time?&quot; The feasible strategy is to explore another feature within dataset and combine an eminent vision-language model (VLM) and Large-Language model (LLM) with their astonishing zero-shot capability. In this work, we propose the special ASE dataset, including rich data description recorded on image, for defect classification, but the defect feature is uneasy to learn directly. Secondly, We present the prompting for VLM-LLM against defect classification with the proposed ASE dataset to activate extra-modality feature from images to enhance performance.

However, the manual creation of these documents is not only time-consuming but also prone to inconsistencies and potential errors. The automation of this documentation process using artificial intelligence (AI) represents a promising area of innovation in healthcare. This study directly addresses the inefficiencies and inaccuracies in creating discharge notes manually, particularly for cardiac patients, by employing AI techniques, specifically large language model (LLM). Utilizing a substantial dataset from a cardiology center, encompassing wide-ranging medical records and physician assessments, our research evaluates the capability of LLM to enhance the documentation process. Among the various models assessed, Mistral-7B distinguished itself by accurately generating discharge notes that significantly improve both documentation efficiency and the continuity of care for patients. These notes underwent rigorous qualitative evaluation by medical expert, receiving high marks for their clinical relevance, completeness, readability, and contribution to informed decision-making and care planning. Coupled with quantitative analyses, these results confirm Mistral-7B&#39;s efficacy in distilling complex medical information into concise, coherent summaries. Overall, our findings illuminate the considerable promise of specialized LLM, such as Mistral-7B, in refining healthcare documentation workflows and advancing patient care. This study lays the groundwork for further integrating advanced AI technologies in healthcare, demonstrating their potential to revolutionize patient documentation and support better care outcomes.</p><h2 id="_2024-04-07" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2024-04-07"><span>2024-04-07</span></a></h2><h4 id="clinical-trials-protocol-authoring-using-llms" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#clinical-trials-protocol-authoring-using-llms"><span>Clinical Trials Protocol Authoring using LLMs</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Morteza Maleki</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05044v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05044v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: This report embarks on a mission to revolutionize clinical trial protocol development through the integration of advanced AI technologies.

Nevertheless, effectively handling extensive contexts, crucial for myriad applications, poses a formidable obstacle owing to the intrinsic constraints of the models&#39; context window sizes and the computational burdens entailed by their operations. This investigation presents an innovative framework that strategically tailors LLMs for streamlined context processing by harnessing the synergies among natural language summarization, soft prompt compression, and augmented utility preservation mechanisms. Our methodology, dubbed SoftPromptComp, amalgamates natural language prompts extracted from summarization methodologies with dynamically generated soft prompts to forge a concise yet semantically robust depiction of protracted contexts. This depiction undergoes further refinement via a weighting mechanism optimizing information retention and utility for subsequent tasks. We substantiate that our framework markedly diminishes computational overhead and enhances LLMs&#39; efficacy across various benchmarks, while upholding or even augmenting the caliber of the produced content. By amalgamating soft prompt compression with sophisticated summarization, SoftPromptComp confronts the dual challenges of managing lengthy contexts and ensuring model scalability. Our findings point towards a propitious trajectory for augmenting LLMs&#39; applicability and efficiency, rendering them more versatile and pragmatic for real-world applications. This research enriches the ongoing discourse on optimizing language models, providing insights into the potency of soft prompts and summarization techniques as pivotal instruments for the forthcoming generation of NLP solutions.</p><h4 id="enhancing-llm-based-test-generation-for-hard-to-cover-branches-via-program-analysis" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#enhancing-llm-based-test-generation-for-hard-to-cover-branches-via-program-analysis"><span>Enhancing LLM-based Test Generation for Hard-to-Cover Branches via Program Analysis</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Chen Yang, Junjie Chen, Bin Lin, Jianyi Zhou, Ziqi Wang</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04966v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04966v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Automatic test generation plays a critical role in software quality assurance. While the recent advances in Search-Based Software Testing (SBST) and Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating useful tests, these techniques still struggle to cover certain branches. Reaching these hard-to-cover branches usually requires constructing complex objects and resolving intricate inter-procedural dependencies in branch conditions, which poses significant challenges for existing test generation techniques. In this work, we propose TELPA, a novel technique aimed at addressing these challenges. Its key insight lies in extracting real usage scenarios of the target method under test to learn how to construct complex objects and extracting methods entailing inter-procedural dependencies with hard-to-cover branches to learn the semantics of branch constraints. To enhance efficiency and effectiveness, TELPA identifies a set of ineffective tests as counter-examples for LLMs and employs a feedback-based process to iteratively refine these counter-examples. Then, TELPA integrates program analysis results and counter-examples into the prompt, guiding LLMs to gain deeper understandings of the semantics of the target method and generate diverse tests that can reach the hard-to-cover branches. Our experimental results on 27 open-source Python projects demonstrate that TELPA significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art SBST and LLM-based techniques, achieving an average improvement of 31.39% and 22.22% in terms of branch coverage.</p><h4 id="ai2apps-a-visual-ide-for-building-llm-based-ai-agent-applications" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ai2apps-a-visual-ide-for-building-llm-based-ai-agent-applications"><span>AI2Apps: A Visual IDE for Building LLM-based AI Agent Applications</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Xin Pang, Zhucong Li, Jiaxiang Chen, Yuan Cheng, Yinghui Xu, Yuan Qi</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04902v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04902v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: We introduce AI2Apps, a Visual Integrated Development Environment (Visual IDE) with full-cycle capabilities that accelerates developers to build deployable LLM-based AI agent Applications.

However, a substantial proportion of existing research predominantly focuses on planning models for robotics that transmute the outputs derived from perception models into linguistic forms, thus adopting a `pure-language&#39; strategy. In this research, we propose a hybrid End-to-End learning framework for autonomous driving by combining basic driving imitation learning with LLMs based on multi-modality prompt tokens. Instead of simply converting perception results from the separated train model into pure language input, our novelty lies in two aspects. 1) The end-to-end integration of visual and LiDAR sensory input into learnable multi-modality tokens, thereby intrinsically alleviating description bias by separated pre-trained perception models. 2) Instead of directly letting LLMs drive, this paper explores a hybrid setting of letting LLMs help the driving model correct mistakes and complicated scenarios. The results of our experiments suggest that the proposed methodology can attain driving scores of 49.21%, coupled with an impressive route completion rate of 91.34% in the offline evaluation conducted via CARLA. These performance metrics are comparable to the most advanced driving models.</p><h4 id="explaining-eda-synthesis-errors-with-llms" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#explaining-eda-synthesis-errors-with-llms"><span>Explaining EDA synthesis errors with LLMs</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Siyu Qiu, Benjamin Tan, Hammond Pearce</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07235v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07235v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Training new engineers in digital design is a challenge, particularly when it comes to teaching the complex electronic design automation (EDA) tooling used in this domain. Learners will typically deploy designs in the Verilog and VHDL hardware description languages to Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) from Altera (Intel) and Xilinx (AMD) via proprietary closed-source toolchains (Quartus Prime and Vivado, respectively). These tools are complex and difficult to use -- yet, as they are the tools used in industry, they are an essential first step in this space. In this work, we examine how recent advances in artificial intelligence may be leveraged to address aspects of this challenge. Specifically, we investigate if Large Language Models (LLMs), which have demonstrated text comprehension and question-answering capabilities, can be used to generate novice-friendly explanations of compile-time synthesis error messages from Quartus Prime and Vivado. To perform this study we generate 936 error message explanations using three OpenAI LLMs over 21 different buggy code samples. These are then graded for relevance and correctness, and we find that in approximately 71% of cases the LLMs give correct &amp; complete explanations suitable for novice learners.</p><h4 id="llm-based-multi-agent-systems-for-software-engineering-vision-and-the-road-ahead" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#llm-based-multi-agent-systems-for-software-engineering-vision-and-the-road-ahead"><span>LLM-Based Multi-Agent Systems for Software Engineering: Vision and the Road Ahead</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Junda He, Christoph Treude, David Lo</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04834v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04834v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Integrating Large Language Models(LLMs) into autonomous agents marks a significant shift in the research landscape by offering cognitive abilities competitive to human planning and reasoning.

Leveraging a novel corpus derived from a Mambai language manual and additional sentences translated by a native speaker, we examine the efficacy of few-shot LLM prompting for machine translation (MT) in this low-resource context. Our methodology involves the strategic selection of parallel sentences and dictionary entries for prompting, aiming to enhance translation accuracy, using open-source and proprietary LLMs (LlaMa 2 70b, Mixtral 8x7B, GPT-4). We find that including dictionary entries in prompts and a mix of sentences retrieved through TF-IDF and semantic embeddings significantly improves translation quality. However, our findings reveal stark disparities in translation performance across test sets, with BLEU scores reaching as high as 21.2 on materials from the language manual, in contrast to a maximum of 4.4 on a test set provided by a native speaker. These results underscore the importance of diverse and representative corpora in assessing MT for low-resource languages.

Most of the existing KV-cache compression algorithms attempted to sparsify the sequence of tokens by taking advantage of the different importance of tokens. In this work, we found that by identifying the importance of attention layers, we could optimize the KV-cache jointly from two dimensions. Based on our observations regarding layer-wise importance in inference, we propose SqueezeAttention to precisely optimize the allocation of KV-cache budget among layers on-the-fly and then incorporate three representative token sparsification algorithms to compress the KV-cache for each layer with its very own budget. By optimizing the KV-cache from both sequence&#39;s and layer&#39;s dimensions, SqueezeAttention achieves around 30% to 70% of the memory reductions and up to 2.2 times of throughput improvements in a wide range of LLMs and benchmarks.

Multicalibration asks for calibration not just marginally, but simultaneously across various intersecting groupings of the data. We show how to form groupings for prompt/completion pairs that are correlated with the probability of correctness via two techniques: clustering within an embedding space, and &quot;self-annotation&quot; - querying the LLM by asking it various yes-or-no questions about the prompt. We also develop novel variants of multicalibration algorithms that offer performance improvements by reducing their tendency to overfit. Through systematic benchmarking across various question answering datasets and LLMs, we show how our techniques can yield confidence scores that provide substantial improvements in fine-grained measures of both calibration and accuracy compared to existing methods.</p><h4 id="on-the-limitations-of-large-language-models-llms-false-attribution" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#on-the-limitations-of-large-language-models-llms-false-attribution"><span>On the Limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs): False Attribution</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Tosin Adewumi, Nudrat Habib, Lama Alkhaled, Elisa Barney</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04631v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04631v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: In this work, we provide insight into one important limitation of large language models (LLMs), i.e. false attribution, and introduce a new hallucination metric - Simple Hallucination Index (SHI). The task of automatic author attribution for relatively small chunks of text is an important NLP task but can be challenging. We empirically evaluate the power of 3 open SotA LLMs in zero-shot setting (LLaMA-2-13B, Mixtral 8x7B, and Gemma-7B), especially as human annotation can be costly. We collected the top 10 most popular books, according to Project Gutenberg, divided each one into equal chunks of 400 words, and asked each LLM to predict the author. We then randomly sampled 162 chunks for human evaluation from each of the annotated books, based on the error margin of 7% and a confidence level of 95% for the book with the most chunks (Great Expectations by Charles Dickens, having 922 chunks). The average results show that Mixtral 8x7B has the highest prediction accuracy, the lowest SHI, and a Pearson&#39;s correlation (r) of 0.737, 0.249, and -0.9996, respectively, followed by LLaMA-2-13B and Gemma-7B. However, Mixtral 8x7B suffers from high hallucinations for 3 books, rising as high as an SHI of 0.87 (in the range 0-1, where 1 is the worst). The strong negative correlation of accuracy and SHI, given by r, demonstrates the fidelity of the new hallucination metric, which is generalizable to other tasks. We publicly release the annotated chunks of data and our codes to aid the reproducibility and evaluation of other models.</p><h4 id="analyzing-llm-usage-in-an-advanced-computing-class-in-india" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#analyzing-llm-usage-in-an-advanced-computing-class-in-india"><span>Analyzing LLM Usage in an Advanced Computing Class in India</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Chaitanya Arora, Utkarsh Venaik, Pavit Singh, Sahil Goyal, Jatin Tyagi, Shyama Goel, Ujjwal Singhal, Dhruv Kumar</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04603v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04603v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: This paper investigates the usage patterns of undergraduate and graduate students when engaging with large language models (LLMs) to tackle programming assignments in the context of advanced computing courses. Existing work predominantly focuses on the influence of LLMs in introductory programming contexts. Additionally, there is a scarcity of studies analyzing actual conversations between students and LLMs. Our study provides a comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analysis of raw interactions between students and LLMs within an advanced computing course (Distributed Systems) at an Indian University. We further complement this by conducting student interviews to gain deeper insights into their usage patterns. Our study shows that students make use of large language models (LLMs) in various ways: generating code or debugging code by identifying and fixing errors. They also copy and paste assignment descriptions into LLM interfaces for specific solutions, ask conceptual questions about complex programming ideas or theoretical concepts, and generate test cases to check code functionality and robustness. Our analysis includes over 4,000 prompts from 411 students and conducting interviews with 10 students. Our analysis shows that LLMs excel at generating boilerplate code and assisting in debugging, while students handle the integration of components and system troubleshooting. This aligns with the learning objectives of advanced computing courses, which are oriented towards teaching students how to build systems and troubleshoot, with less emphasis on generating code from scratch. Therefore, LLM tools can be leveraged to increase student productivity, as shown by the data we collected. This study contributes to the ongoing discussion on LLM use in education, advocating for their usefulness in advanced computing courses to complement higher-level learning and productivity.</p><h4 id="a-map-of-exploring-human-interaction-patterns-with-llm-insights-into-collaboration-and-creativity" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#a-map-of-exploring-human-interaction-patterns-with-llm-insights-into-collaboration-and-creativity"><span>A Map of Exploring Human Interaction patterns with LLM: Insights into Collaboration and Creativity</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Jiayang Li, Jiale Li</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04570v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04570v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: The outstanding performance capabilities of large language model have driven the evolution of current AI system interaction patterns. This has led to considerable discussion within the Human-AI Interaction (HAII) community. Numerous studies explore this interaction from technical, design, and empirical perspectives. However, the majority of current literature reviews concentrate on interactions across the wider spectrum of AI, with limited attention given to the specific realm of interaction with LLM. We searched for articles on human interaction with LLM, selecting 110 relevant publications meeting consensus definition of Human-AI interaction. Subsequently, we developed a comprehensive Mapping Procedure, structured in five distinct stages, to systematically analyze and categorize the collected publications. Applying this methodical approach, we meticulously mapped the chosen studies, culminating in a detailed and insightful representation of the research landscape. Overall, our review presents an novel approach, introducing a distinctive mapping method, specifically tailored to evaluate human-LLM interaction patterns. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of the current research in related fields, employing clustering techniques for categorization, which enabled us to clearly delineate the status and challenges prevalent in each identified area.</p><h4 id="iitk-at-semeval-2024-task-2-exploring-the-capabilities-of-llms-for-safe-biomedical-natural-language-inference-for-clinical-trials" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#iitk-at-semeval-2024-task-2-exploring-the-capabilities-of-llms-for-safe-biomedical-natural-language-inference-for-clinical-trials"><span>IITK at SemEval-2024 Task 2: Exploring the Capabilities of LLMs for Safe Biomedical Natural Language Inference for Clinical Trials</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Shreyasi Mandal, Ashutosh Modi</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04510v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04510v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Large Language models (LLMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks across multiple domains, yet they are prone to shortcut learning and factual inconsistencies.

However, LLMs are vulnerable to different types of attacks, such as jailbreaking, prompt injection attacks, and privacy leakage attacks. Foundational LLMs undergo adversarial and alignment training to learn not to generate malicious and toxic content. For specialized use cases, these foundational LLMs are subjected to fine-tuning or quantization for better performance and efficiency. We examine the impact of downstream tasks such as fine-tuning and quantization on LLM vulnerability. We test foundation models like Mistral, Llama, MosaicML, and their fine-tuned versions. Our research shows that fine-tuning and quantization reduces jailbreak resistance significantly, leading to increased LLM vulnerabilities.

However, it is difficult to precisely specify many common classes of image transformations with text alone. For example, a user may wish to change the location and breed of a particular dog in an image with several similar dogs. This task is quite difficult with natural language alone, and would require a user to write a laboriously complex prompt that both disambiguates the target dog and describes the destination. We propose ClickDiffusion, a system for precise image manipulation and generation that combines natural language instructions with visual feedback provided by the user through a direct manipulation interface. We demonstrate that by serializing both an image and a multi-modal instruction into a textual representation it is possible to leverage LLMs to perform precise transformations of the layout and appearance of an image.

State-of-the-art video Large Language Models (vLLMs) hold promise as a viable solution due to their demonstrated emergent capabilities on new tasks. However, despite being trained on millions of short seconds-long videos, vLLMs are unable to understand minutes-long videos and accurately answer questions about them. To address this limitation, we propose a lightweight and self-supervised approach, Key frame-conditioned long video-LLM (Koala), that introduces learnable spatiotemporal queries to adapt pretrained vLLMs for generalizing to longer videos. Our approach introduces two new tokenizers that condition on visual tokens computed from sparse video key frames for understanding short and long video moments. We train our proposed approach on HowTo100M and demonstrate its effectiveness on zero-shot long video understanding benchmarks, where it outperforms state-of-the-art large models by 3 - 6% in absolute accuracy across all tasks. Surprisingly, we also empirically show that our approach not only helps a pretrained vLLM to understand long videos but also improves its accuracy on short-term action recognition.</p><h4 id="sentiment-analysis-and-random-forest-to-classify-llm-versus-human-source-applied-to-scientific-texts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#sentiment-analysis-and-random-forest-to-classify-llm-versus-human-source-applied-to-scientific-texts"><span>Sentiment analysis and random forest to classify LLM versus human source applied to Scientific Texts</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Javier J.

In this work it is proposed a new methodology to classify texts coming from an automatic text production engine or a human, based on Sentiment Analysis as a source for feature engineering independent variables and then train with them a Random Forest classification algorithm. Using four different sentiment lexicons, a number of new features where produced, and then fed to a machine learning random forest methodology, to train such a model.

By open-sourcing the full process of training a Chinese LLM, including a detailed data processing procedure with the obtained Massive Appropriate Pretraining Chinese Corpus (MAP-CC), a well-chosen multidisciplinary Chinese Hard Case Benchmark (CHC-Bench), and the 2B-size Chinese Tiny LLM (CT-LLM), we aim to foster further exploration and innovation in both academia and industry, paving the way for more inclusive and versatile language models.</p><h4 id="robust-preference-optimization-with-provable-noise-tolerance-for-llms" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#robust-preference-optimization-with-provable-noise-tolerance-for-llms"><span>Robust Preference Optimization with Provable Noise Tolerance for LLMs</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Xize Liang, Chao Chen, Jie Wang, Yue Wu, Zhihang Fu, Zhihao Shi, Feng Wu, Jieping Ye</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04102v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04102v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: The preference alignment aims to enable large language models (LLMs) to generate responses that conform to human values, which is essential for developing general AI systems. Ranking-based methods -- a promising class of alignment approaches -- learn human preferences from datasets containing response pairs by optimizing the log-likelihood margins between preferred and dis-preferred responses. However, due to the inherent differences in annotators&#39; preferences, ranking labels of comparisons for response pairs are unavoidably noisy. This seriously hurts the reliability of existing ranking-based methods. To address this problem, we propose a provably noise-tolerant preference alignment method, namely RObust Preference Optimization (ROPO). To the best of our knowledge, ROPO is the first preference alignment method with noise-tolerance guarantees. The key idea of ROPO is to dynamically assign conservative gradient weights to response pairs with high label uncertainty, based on the log-likelihood margins between the responses. By effectively suppressing the gradients of noisy samples, our weighting strategy ensures that the expected risk has the same gradient direction independent of the presence and proportion of noise. Experiments on three open-ended text generation tasks with four base models ranging in size from 2.8B to 13B demonstrate that ROPO significantly outperforms existing ranking-based methods.</p><h4 id="clue-a-clinical-language-understanding-evaluation-for-llms" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#clue-a-clinical-language-understanding-evaluation-for-llms"><span>CLUE: A Clinical Language Understanding Evaluation for LLMs</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Amin Dada, Marie Bauer, Amanda Butler Contreras, Osman Alperen Koraş, Constantin Marc Seibold, Kaleb E Smith, Jens Kleesiek</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04067v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04067v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown the potential to significantly contribute to patient care, diagnostics, and administrative processes. Emerging biomedical LLMs address healthcare-specific challenges, including privacy demands and computational constraints. However, evaluation of these models has primarily been limited to non-clinical tasks, which do not reflect the complexity of practical clinical applications. Additionally, there has been no thorough comparison between biomedical and general-domain LLMs for clinical tasks. To fill this gap, we present the Clinical Language Understanding Evaluation (CLUE), a benchmark tailored to evaluate LLMs on real-world clinical tasks. CLUE includes two novel datasets derived from MIMIC IV discharge letters and four existing tasks designed to test the practical applicability of LLMs in healthcare settings. Our evaluation covers several biomedical and general domain LLMs, providing insights into their clinical performance and applicability. CLUE represents a step towards a standardized approach to evaluating and developing LLMs in healthcare to align future model development with the real-world needs of clinical application.

Speech interfaces, especially ones that utilize Large Language Models (LLMs), can enable individuals to effectively and naturally communicate high-level commands and nuanced preferences to robots. Frameworks for integrating LLMs as interfaces to robots for high level task planning and code generation have been proposed, but fail to incorporate human-centric considerations which are essential while developing assistive interfaces. In this work, we present a framework for incorporating LLMs as speech interfaces for physically assistive robots, constructed iteratively with 3 stages of testing involving a feeding robot, culminating in an evaluation with 11 older adults at an independent living facility. We use both quantitative and qualitative data from the final study to validate our framework and additionally provide design guidelines for using LLMs as speech interfaces for assistive robots.

In particular, LLMs are utilized as domain-agnostic task planners for high-level human commands. LLMs are capable of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, and this allows LLMs to be task planners. However, we need to consider that modern robots still struggle to perform complex actions, and the domains where robots can be deployed are limited in practice. This leads us to pose a question: If small LMs can be trained to reason in chains within a single domain, would even small LMs be good task planners for the robots? To train smaller LMs to reason in chains, we build `COmmand-STeps datasets&#39; (COST) consisting of high-level commands along with corresponding actionable low-level steps, via LLMs. We release not only our datasets but also the prompt templates used to generate them, to allow anyone to build datasets for their domain. We compare GPT3.5 and GPT4 with the finetuned GPT2 for task domains, in tabletop and kitchen environments, and the result shows that GPT2-medium is comparable to GPT3.5 for task planning in a specific domain.

Progress on large language models (LLMs) has prompted a series of recent works applying them to KGC, e.g., via zero/few-shot prompting. Despite successes on small domain-specific datasets, these models face difficulties scaling up to text common in many real-world applications. A principal issue is that in prior methods, the KG schema has to be included in the LLM prompt to generate valid triplets; larger and more complex schema easily exceed the LLMs&#39; context window length. To address this problem, we propose a three-phase framework named Extract-Define-Canonicalize (EDC): open information extraction followed by schema definition and post-hoc canonicalization. EDC is flexible in that it can be applied to settings where a pre-defined target schema is available and when it is not; in the latter case, it constructs a schema automatically and applies self-canonicalization. To further improve performance, we introduce a trained component that retrieves schema elements relevant to the input text; this improves the LLMs&#39; extraction performance in a retrieval-augmented generation-like manner. We demonstrate on three KGC benchmarks that EDC is able to extract high-quality triplets without any parameter tuning and with significantly larger schemas compared to prior works.</p><h2 id="_2024-04-04" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2024-04-04"><span>2024-04-04</span></a></h2><h4 id="cbr-rag-case-based-reasoning-for-retrieval-augmented-generation-in-llms-for-legal-question-answering" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#cbr-rag-case-based-reasoning-for-retrieval-augmented-generation-in-llms-for-legal-question-answering"><span>CBR-RAG: Case-Based Reasoning for Retrieval Augmented Generation in LLMs for Legal Question Answering</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Nirmalie Wiratunga, Ramitha Abeyratne, Lasal Jayawardena, Kyle Martin, Stewart Massie, Ikechukwu Nkisi-Orji, Ruvan Weerasinghe, Anne Liret, Bruno Fleisch</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04302v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04302v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Model (LLM) output by providing prior knowledge as context to input.

We highlight that Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) presents key opportunities to structure retrieval as part of the RAG process in an LLM. We introduce CBR-RAG, where CBR cycle&#39;s initial retrieval stage, its indexing vocabulary, and similarity knowledge containers are used to enhance LLM queries with contextually relevant cases. This integration augments the original LLM query, providing a richer prompt. We present an evaluation of CBR-RAG, and examine different representations (i.e. general and domain-specific embeddings) and methods of comparison (i.e. inter, intra and hybrid similarity) on the task of legal question-answering. Our results indicate that the context provided by CBR&#39;s case reuse enforces similarity between relevant components of the questions and the evidence base leading to significant improvements in the quality of generated answers.</p><h4 id="self-in-correct-llms-struggle-with-refining-self-generated-responses" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#self-in-correct-llms-struggle-with-refining-self-generated-responses"><span>SELF-[IN]CORRECT: LLMs Struggle with Refining Self-Generated Responses</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Dongwei Jiang, Jingyu Zhang, Orion Weller, Nathaniel Weir, Benjamin Van Durme, Daniel Khashabi</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04298v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04298v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Can LLMs continually improve their previous outputs for better results?

In this context, we propose an ensemble based prompting technique, GenQREnsemble which leverages paraphrases of a zero-shot instruction to generate multiple sets of keywords ultimately improving retrieval performance. We further introduce its post-retrieval variant, GenQREnsembleRF to incorporate pseudo relevant feedback. On evaluations over four IR benchmarks, we find that GenQREnsemble generates better reformulations with relative nDCG@10 improvements up to 18% and MAP improvements upto 24% over the previous zero-shot state-of-art.

Code for the system described in this paper is available on Github.</p><h4 id="training-llms-over-neurally-compressed-text" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#training-llms-over-neurally-compressed-text"><span>Training LLMs over Neurally Compressed Text</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Brian Lester, Jaehoon Lee, Alex Alemi, Jeffrey Pennington, Adam Roberts, Jascha Sohl-Dickstein, Noah Constant</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03626v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03626v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: In this paper, we explore the idea of training large language models (LLMs) over highly compressed text. While standard subword tokenizers compress text by a small factor, neural text compressors can achieve much higher rates of compression. If it were possible to train LLMs directly over neurally compressed text, this would confer advantages in training and serving efficiency, as well as easier handling of long text spans. The main obstacle to this goal is that strong compression tends to produce opaque outputs that are not well-suited for learning. In particular, we find that text na&quot;ively compressed via Arithmetic Coding is not readily learnable by LLMs. To overcome this, we propose Equal-Info Windows, a novel compression technique whereby text is segmented into blocks that each compress to the same bit length. Using this method, we demonstrate effective learning over neurally compressed text that improves with scale, and outperforms byte-level baselines by a wide margin on perplexity and inference speed benchmarks. While our method delivers worse perplexity than subword tokenizers for models trained with the same parameter count, it has the benefit of shorter sequence lengths. Shorter sequence lengths require fewer autoregressive generation steps, and reduce latency. Finally, we provide extensive analysis of the properties that contribute to learnability, and offer concrete suggestions for how to further improve the performance of high-compression tokenizers.</p><h4 id="unveiling-llms-the-evolution-of-latent-representations-in-a-temporal-knowledge-graph" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#unveiling-llms-the-evolution-of-latent-representations-in-a-temporal-knowledge-graph"><span>Unveiling LLMs: The Evolution of Latent Representations in a Temporal Knowledge Graph</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Marco Bronzini, Carlo Nicolini, Bruno Lepri, Jacopo Staiano, Andrea Passerini</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03623v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03623v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate an impressive capacity to recall a vast range of common factual knowledge information. However, unravelling the underlying reasoning of LLMs and explaining their internal mechanisms of exploiting this factual knowledge remain active areas of investigation. Our work analyzes the factual knowledge encoded in the latent representation of LLMs when prompted to assess the truthfulness of factual claims. We propose an end-to-end framework that jointly decodes the factual knowledge embedded in the latent space of LLMs from a vector space to a set of ground predicates and represents its evolution across the layers using a temporal knowledge graph. Our framework relies on the technique of activation patching which intervenes in the inference computation of a model by dynamically altering its latent representations. Consequently, we neither rely on external models nor training processes. We showcase our framework with local and global interpretability analyses using two claim verification datasets: FEVER and CLIMATE-FEVER. The local interpretability analysis exposes different latent errors from representation to multi-hop reasoning errors. On the other hand, the global analysis uncovered patterns in the underlying evolution of the model&#39;s factual knowledge (e.g., store-and-seek factual information). By enabling graph-based analyses of the latent representations, this work represents a step towards the mechanistic interpretability of LLMs.</p><h4 id="evaluating-llms-at-detecting-errors-in-llm-responses" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#evaluating-llms-at-detecting-errors-in-llm-responses"><span>Evaluating LLMs at Detecting Errors in LLM Responses</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Ryo Kamoi, Sarkar Snigdha Sarathi Das, Renze Lou, Jihyun Janice Ahn, Yilun Zhao, Xiaoxin Lu, Nan Zhang, Yusen Zhang, Ranran Haoran Zhang, Sujeeth Reddy Vummanthala, Salika Dave, Shaobo Qin, Arman Cohan, Wenpeng Yin, Rui Zhang</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03602v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03602v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: With Large Language Models (LLMs) being widely used across various tasks, detecting errors in their responses is increasingly crucial. However, little research has been conducted on error detection of LLM responses. Collecting error annotations on LLM responses is challenging due to the subjective nature of many NLP tasks, and thus previous research focuses on tasks of little practical value (e.g., word sorting) or limited error types (e.g., faithfulness in summarization). This work introduces ReaLMistake, the first error detection benchmark consisting of objective, realistic, and diverse errors made by LLMs. ReaLMistake contains three challenging and meaningful tasks that introduce objectively assessable errors in four categories (reasoning correctness, instruction-following, context-faithfulness, and parameterized knowledge), eliciting naturally observed and diverse errors in responses of GPT-4 and Llama 2 70B annotated by experts. We use ReaLMistake to evaluate error detectors based on 12 LLMs. Our findings show: 1) Top LLMs like GPT-4 and Claude 3 detect errors made by LLMs at very low recall, and all LLM-based error detectors perform much worse than humans. 2) Explanations by LLM-based error detectors lack reliability. 3) LLMs-based error detection is sensitive to small changes in prompts but remains challenging to improve. 4) Popular approaches to improving LLMs, including self-consistency and majority vote, do not improve the error detection performance.

LLMs, such as GPT models and Llama2, have shown effectiveness in natural language understanding tasks, and prior works (e.g., RankGPT) have also demonstrated that the LLMs exhibit better performance than the traditional ranking models in the ranking task. However, their fairness remains largely unexplored. This paper presents an empirical study evaluating these LLMs using the TREC Fair Ranking dataset, focusing on the representation of binary protected attributes such as gender and geographic location, which are historically underrepresented in search outcomes. Our analysis delves into how these LLMs handle queries and documents related to these attributes, aiming to uncover biases in their ranking algorithms. We assess fairness from both user and content perspectives, contributing an empirical benchmark for evaluating LLMs as the fair ranker.</p><h4 id="robust-pronoun-use-fidelity-with-english-llms-are-they-reasoning-repeating-or-just-biased" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#robust-pronoun-use-fidelity-with-english-llms-are-they-reasoning-repeating-or-just-biased"><span>Robust Pronoun Use Fidelity with English LLMs: Are they Reasoning, Repeating, or Just Biased?</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Vagrant Gautam, Eileen Bingert, Dawei Zhu, Anne Lauscher, Dietrich Klakow</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03134v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03134v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Robust, faithful and harm-free pronoun use for individuals is an important goal for language models as their use increases, but prior work tends to study only one or two of these components at a time. To measure progress towards the combined goal, we introduce the task of pronoun use fidelity: given a context introducing a co-referring entity and pronoun, the task is to reuse the correct pronoun later, independent of potential distractors. We present a carefully-designed dataset of over 5 million instances to evaluate pronoun use fidelity in English, and we use it to evaluate 37 popular large language models across architectures (encoder-only, decoder-only and encoder-decoder) and scales (11M-70B parameters). We find that while models can mostly faithfully reuse previously-specified pronouns in the presence of no distractors, they are significantly worse at processing she/her/her, singular they and neopronouns. Additionally, models are not robustly faithful to pronouns, as they are easily distracted. With even one additional sentence containing a distractor pronoun, accuracy drops on average by 34%. With 5 distractor sentences, accuracy drops by 52% for decoder-only models and 13% for encoder-only models. We show that widely-used large language models are still brittle, with large gaps in reasoning and in processing different pronouns in a setting that is very simple for humans, and we encourage researchers in bias and reasoning to bridge them.</p><h4 id="towards-standards-compliant-assistive-technology-product-specifications-via-llms" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#towards-standards-compliant-assistive-technology-product-specifications-via-llms"><span>Towards Standards-Compliant Assistive Technology Product Specifications via LLMs</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Chetan Arora, John Grundy, Louise Puli, Natasha Layton</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03122v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03122v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: In the rapidly evolving field of assistive technology (AT), ensuring that products meet national and international standards is essential for user safety, efficacy, and accessibility.

CompliAT addresses three critical tasks: checking terminology consistency, classifying products according to standards, and tracing key product specifications to standard requirements. We tackle the challenge of terminology consistency to ensure that the language used in product specifications aligns with relevant standards, reducing misunderstandings and non-compliance risks. We propose a novel approach for product classification, leveraging a retrieval-augmented generation model to accurately categorize AT products aligning to international standards, despite the sparse availability of training data. Finally, CompliAT implements a traceability and compliance mechanism from key product specifications to standard requirements, ensuring all aspects of an AT product are thoroughly vetted against the corresponding standards. By semi-automating these processes, CompliAT aims to significantly reduce the time and effort required for AT product standards compliance and uphold quality and safety standards.

Developed via manual curation, with the additional assistance of large language models (LLMs), AIO aims to address the rapidly evolving landscape of AI by providing a comprehensive framework that encompasses both technical and ethical aspects of AI technologies. The primary audience for AIO includes AI researchers, developers, and educators seeking standardized terminology and concepts within the AI domain. The ontology is structured around six top-level branches: Networks, Layers, Functions, LLMs, Preprocessing, and Bias, each designed to support the modular composition of AI methods and facilitate a deeper understanding of deep learning architectures and ethical considerations in AI. AIO&#39;s development utilized the Ontology Development Kit (ODK) for its creation and maintenance, with its content being dynamically updated through AI-driven curation support. This approach not only ensures the ontology&#39;s relevance amidst the fast-paced advancements in AI but also significantly enhances its utility for researchers, developers, and educators by simplifying the integration of new AI concepts and methodologies. The ontology&#39;s utility is demonstrated through the annotation of AI methods data in a catalog of AI research publications and the integration into the BioPortal ontology resource, highlighting its potential for cross-disciplinary research. The AIO ontology is open source and is available on GitHub (https://github.com/berkeleybop/artificial-intelligence-ontology) and BioPortal (https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/AIO).</p><h4 id="i-design-personalized-llm-interior-designer" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#i-design-personalized-llm-interior-designer"><span>I-Design: Personalized LLM Interior Designer</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Ata Çelen, Guo Han, Konrad Schindler, Luc Van Gool, Iro Armeni, Anton Obukhov, Xi Wang</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02838v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02838v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Interior design allows us to be who we are and live how we want - each design is as unique as our distinct personality. However, it is not trivial for non-professionals to express and materialize this since it requires aligning functional and visual expectations with the constraints of physical space; this renders interior design a luxury. To make it more accessible, we present I-Design, a personalized interior designer that allows users to generate and visualize their design goals through natural language communication. I-Design starts with a team of large language model agents that engage in dialogues and logical reasoning with one another, transforming textual user input into feasible scene graph designs with relative object relationships. Subsequently, an effective placement algorithm determines optimal locations for each object within the scene. The final design is then constructed in 3D by retrieving and integrating assets from an existing object database. Additionally, we propose a new evaluation protocol that utilizes a vision-language model and complements the design pipeline. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments show that I-Design outperforms existing methods in delivering high-quality 3D design solutions and aligning with abstract concepts that match user input, showcasing its advantages across detailed 3D arrangement and conceptual fidelity.</p><h4 id="aqua-combining-experts-and-non-experts-views-to-assess-deliberation-quality-in-online-discussions-using-llms" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#aqua-combining-experts-and-non-experts-views-to-assess-deliberation-quality-in-online-discussions-using-llms"><span>AQuA -- Combining Experts&#39; and Non-Experts&#39; Views To Assess Deliberation Quality in Online Discussions Using LLMs</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Maike Behrendt, Stefan Sylvius Wagner, Marc Ziegele, Lena Wilms, Anke Stoll, Dominique Heinbach, Stefan Harmeling</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02761v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02761v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Measuring the quality of contributions in political online discussions is crucial in deliberation research and computer science. Research has identified various indicators to assess online discussion quality, and with deep learning advancements, automating these measures has become feasible. While some studies focus on analyzing specific quality indicators, a comprehensive quality score incorporating various deliberative aspects is often preferred. In this work, we introduce AQuA, an additive score that calculates a unified deliberative quality score from multiple indices for each discussion post. Unlike other singular scores, AQuA preserves information on the deliberative aspects present in comments, enhancing model transparency. We develop adapter models for 20 deliberative indices, and calculate correlation coefficients between experts&#39; annotations and the perceived deliberativeness by non-experts to weigh the individual indices into a single deliberative score. We demonstrate that the AQuA score can be computed easily from pre-trained adapters and aligns well with annotations on other datasets that have not be seen during training. The analysis of experts&#39; vs. non-experts&#39; annotations confirms theoretical findings in the social science literature.</p><h4 id="unblind-text-inputs-predicting-hint-text-of-text-input-in-mobile-apps-via-llm" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#unblind-text-inputs-predicting-hint-text-of-text-input-in-mobile-apps-via-llm"><span>Unblind Text Inputs: Predicting Hint-text of Text Input in Mobile Apps via LLM</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Zhe Liu, Chunyang Chen, Junjie Wang, Mengzhuo Chen, Boyu Wu, Yuekai Huang, Jun Hu, Qing Wang</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02706v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02706v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Mobile apps have become indispensable for accessing and participating in various environments, especially for low-vision users. Users with visual impairments can use screen readers to read the content of each screen and understand the content that needs to be operated. Screen readers need to read the hint-text attribute in the text input component to remind visually impaired users what to fill in. Unfortunately, based on our analysis of 4,501 Android apps with text inputs, over 0.76 of them are missing hint-text. These issues are mostly caused by developers&#39; lack of awareness when considering visually impaired individuals. To overcome these challenges, we developed an LLM-based hint-text generation model called HintDroid, which analyzes the GUI information of input components and uses in-context learning to generate the hint-text. To ensure the quality of hint-text generation, we further designed a feedback-based inspection mechanism to further adjust hint-text. The automated experiments demonstrate the high BLEU and a user study further confirms its usefulness. HintDroid can not only help visually impaired individuals, but also help ordinary people understand the requirements of input components.

In most social search scenarios such as Dianping, modeling search relevance always faces two challenges. One is that many documents in social search are very long and have much redundant information. The other is that the training data for search relevance model is difficult to get, especially for multi-classification relevance model. To tackle above two problems, we first take query concatenated with the query-based summary and the document summary without query as the input of topic relevance model, which can help model learn the relevance degree between query and the core topic of document. Then, we utilize the language understanding and generation abilities of large language model (LLM) to rewrite and generate query from queries and documents in existing training data, which can construct new query-document pairs as training data. Extensive offline experiments and online A/B tests show that the proposed approaches effectively improve the performance of relevance modeling.</p><h4 id="learn-to-disguise-avoid-refusal-responses-in-llm-s-defense-via-a-multi-agent-attacker-disguiser-game" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#learn-to-disguise-avoid-refusal-responses-in-llm-s-defense-via-a-multi-agent-attacker-disguiser-game"><span>Learn to Disguise: Avoid Refusal Responses in LLM&#39;s Defense via a Multi-agent Attacker-Disguiser Game</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Qianqiao Xu, Zhiliang Tian, Hongyan Wu, Zhen Huang, Yiping Song, Feng Liu, Dongsheng Li</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02532v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02532v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: With the enhanced performance of large models on natural language processing tasks, potential moral and ethical issues of large models arise. There exist malicious attackers who induce large models to jailbreak and generate information containing illegal, privacy-invasive information through techniques such as prompt engineering. As a result, large models counter malicious attackers&#39; attacks using techniques such as safety alignment. However, the strong defense mechanism of the large model through rejection replies is easily identified by attackers and used to strengthen attackers&#39; capabilities. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent attacker-disguiser game approach to achieve a weak defense mechanism that allows the large model to both safely reply to the attacker and hide the defense intent. First, we construct a multi-agent framework to simulate attack and defense scenarios, playing different roles to be responsible for attack, disguise, safety evaluation, and disguise evaluation tasks. After that, we design attack and disguise game algorithms to optimize the game strategies of the attacker and the disguiser and use the curriculum learning process to strengthen the capabilities of the agents. The experiments verify that the method in this paper is more effective in strengthening the model&#39;s ability to disguise the defense intent compared with other methods. Moreover, our approach can adapt any black-box large model to assist the model in defense and does not suffer from model version iterations.</p><h4 id="utebc-nlp-at-semeval-2024-task-9-can-llms-be-lateral-thinkers" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#utebc-nlp-at-semeval-2024-task-9-can-llms-be-lateral-thinkers"><span>uTeBC-NLP at SemEval-2024 Task 9: Can LLMs be Lateral Thinkers?</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Pouya Sadeghi, Amirhossein Abaskohi, Yadollah Yaghoobzadeh</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02474v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02474v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Inspired by human cognition, Jiang et al.(2023c) create a benchmark for assessing LLMs&#39; lateral thinking-thinking outside the box.

The scarcity of data and the absence of preexisting tools exacerbate these challenges, especially since these languages may not be adequately represented in various NLP datasets. To address this gap, we propose leveraging the potential of LLMs in the active learning loop for data annotation. Initially, we conduct evaluations to assess inter-annotator agreement and consistency, facilitating the selection of a suitable LLM annotator. The chosen annotator is then integrated into a training loop for a classifier using an active learning paradigm, minimizing the amount of queried data required. Empirical evaluations, notably employing GPT-4-Turbo, demonstrate near-state-of-the-art performance with significantly reduced data requirements, as indicated by estimated potential cost savings of at least 42.45 times compared to human annotation. Our proposed solution shows promising potential to substantially reduce both the monetary and computational costs associated with automation in low-resource settings. By bridging the gap between low-resource languages and AI, this approach fosters broader inclusion and shows the potential to enable automation across diverse linguistic landscapes.</p><h4 id="jailbreaking-leading-safety-aligned-llms-with-simple-adaptive-attacks" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#jailbreaking-leading-safety-aligned-llms-with-simple-adaptive-attacks"><span>Jailbreaking Leading Safety-Aligned LLMs with Simple Adaptive Attacks</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Maksym Andriushchenko, Francesco Croce, Nicolas Flammarion</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02151v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02151v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: We show that even the most recent safety-aligned LLMs are not robust to simple adaptive jailbreaking attacks. First, we demonstrate how to successfully leverage access to logprobs for jailbreaking: we initially design an adversarial prompt template (sometimes adapted to the target LLM), and then we apply random search on a suffix to maximize the target logprob (e.g., of the token &quot;Sure&quot;), potentially with multiple restarts. In this way, we achieve nearly 100% attack success rate -- according to GPT-4 as a judge -- on GPT-3.5/4, Llama-2-Chat-7B/13B/70B, Gemma-7B, and R2D2 from HarmBench that was adversarially trained against the GCG attack. We also show how to jailbreak all Claude models -- that do not expose logprobs -- via either a transfer or prefilling attack with 100% success rate. In addition, we show how to use random search on a restricted set of tokens for finding trojan strings in poisoned models -- a task that shares many similarities with jailbreaking -- which is the algorithm that brought us the first place in the SaTML&#39;24 Trojan Detection Competition. The common theme behind these attacks is that adaptivity is crucial: different models are vulnerable to different prompting templates (e.g., R2D2 is very sensitive to in-context learning prompts), some models have unique vulnerabilities based on their APIs (e.g., prefilling for Claude), and in some settings it is crucial to restrict the token search space based on prior knowledge (e.g., for trojan detection). We provide the code, prompts, and logs of the attacks at https://github.com/tml-epfl/llm-adaptive-attacks.</p><h4 id="topic-based-watermarks-for-llm-generated-text" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#topic-based-watermarks-for-llm-generated-text"><span>Topic-based Watermarks for LLM-Generated Text</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Alexander Nemecek, Yuzhou Jiang, Erman Ayday</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02138v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02138v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Recent advancements of large language models (LLMs) have resulted in indistinguishable text outputs comparable to human-generated text. Watermarking algorithms are potential tools that offer a way to differentiate between LLM- and human-generated text by embedding detectable signatures within LLM-generated output. However, current watermarking schemes lack robustness against known attacks against watermarking algorithms. In addition, they are impractical considering an LLM generates tens of thousands of text outputs per day and the watermarking algorithm needs to memorize each output it generates for the detection to work. In this work, focusing on the limitations of current watermarking schemes, we propose the concept of a &quot;topic-based watermarking algorithm&quot; for LLMs. The proposed algorithm determines how to generate tokens for the watermarked LLM output based on extracted topics of an input prompt or the output of a non-watermarked LLM. Inspired from previous work, we propose using a pair of lists (that are generated based on the specified extracted topic(s)) that specify certain tokens to be included or excluded while generating the watermarked output of the LLM. Using the proposed watermarking algorithm, we show the practicality of a watermark detection algorithm. Furthermore, we discuss a wide range of attacks that can emerge against watermarking algorithms for LLMs and the benefit of the proposed watermarking scheme for the feasibility of modeling a potential attacker considering its benefit vs. loss.</p><h4 id="advancing-llm-reasoning-generalists-with-preference-trees" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#advancing-llm-reasoning-generalists-with-preference-trees"><span>Advancing LLM Reasoning Generalists with Preference Trees</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Lifan Yuan, Ganqu Cui, Hanbin Wang, Ning Ding, Xingyao Wang, Jia Deng, Boji Shan, Huimin Chen, Ruobing Xie, Yankai Lin, Zhenghao Liu, Bowen Zhou, Hao Peng, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02078v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02078v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: We introduce Eurus, a suite of large language models (LLMs) optimized for reasoning. Finetuned from Mistral-7B and CodeLlama-70B, Eurus models achieve state-of-the-art results among open-source models on a diverse set of benchmarks covering mathematics, code generation, and logical reasoning problems. Notably, Eurus-70B beats GPT-3.5 Turbo in reasoning through a comprehensive benchmarking across 12 tests covering five tasks, and achieves a 33.3% pass@1 accuracy on LeetCode and 32.6% on TheoremQA, two challenging benchmarks, substantially outperforming existing open-source models by margins more than 13.3%. The strong performance of Eurus can be primarily attributed to UltraInteract, our newly-curated large-scale, high-quality alignment dataset specifically designed for complex reasoning tasks. UltraInteract can be used in both supervised fine-tuning and preference learning. For each instruction, it includes a preference tree consisting of (1) reasoning chains with diverse planning strategies in a unified format, (2) multi-turn interaction trajectories with the environment and the critique, and (3) pairwise data to facilitate preference learning. UltraInteract allows us to conduct an in-depth exploration of preference learning for reasoning tasks. Our investigation reveals that some well-established preference learning algorithms may be less suitable for reasoning tasks compared to their effectiveness in general conversations. Inspired by this, we derive a novel reward modeling objective which, together with UltraInteract, leads to a strong reward model.</p><h4 id="long-context-llms-struggle-with-long-in-context-learning" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#long-context-llms-struggle-with-long-in-context-learning"><span>Long-context LLMs Struggle with Long In-context Learning</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Tianle Li, Ge Zhang, Quy Duc Do, Xiang Yue, Wenhu Chen</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02060v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02060v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in handling long sequences exceeding 32K tokens. However, their performance evaluation has largely been confined to metrics like perplexity and synthetic tasks, which may not fully capture their abilities in more nuanced, real-world scenarios. This study introduces a specialized benchmark (LIConBench) focusing on long in-context learning within the realm of extreme-label classification. We meticulously selected six datasets with a label range spanning 28 to 174 classes covering different input (few-shot demonstration) length from 2K to 50K. Our benchmark requires LLMs to comprehend the entire input to recognize the massive label spaces to make correct prediction. We evaluate 13 long-context LLMs on our benchmarks. We find that the long-context LLMs perform relatively well under the token length of 20K and the performance benefits from utilizing the long context window. However, after the context window exceeds 20K, most LLMs except GPT-4 will dip dramatically. This suggests a notable gap in current LLM capabilities for processing and understanding long, context-rich sequences. Further analysis revealed a tendency among models to favor predictions for labels presented towards the end at the sequence. Their ability to reason over multiple pieces in the long sequence is yet to be improved. Our study reveals that long context understanding and reasoning is still a challenging task for the existing LLMs. We believe LIConBench could serve as a more realistic evaluation for the future long context LLMs.</p><h4 id="multitask-based-evaluation-of-open-source-llm-on-software-vulnerability" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#multitask-based-evaluation-of-open-source-llm-on-software-vulnerability"><span>Multitask-based Evaluation of Open-Source LLM on Software Vulnerability</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Xin Yin, Chao Ni</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02056v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02056v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: This paper proposes a pipeline for quantitatively evaluating interactive LLMs using publicly available datasets. We carry out an extensive technical evaluation of LLMs using Big-Vul covering four different common software vulnerability tasks. We evaluate the multitask and multilingual aspects of LLMs based on this dataset. We find that the existing state-of-the-art methods are generally superior to LLMs in software vulnerability detection. Although LLMs improve accuracy when providing context information, they still have limitations in accurately predicting severity ratings for certain CWE types. In addition, LLMs demonstrate some ability to locate vulnerabilities for certain CWE types, but their performance varies among different CWE types. Finally, LLMs show uneven performance in generating CVE descriptions for various CWE types, with limited accuracy in a few-shot setting. Overall, though LLMs perform well in some aspects, they still need improvement in understanding the subtle differences in code vulnerabilities and the ability to describe vulnerabilities to fully realize their potential. Our evaluation pipeline provides valuable insights for further enhancing LLMs&#39; software vulnerability handling capabilities.</p><h4 id="muxserve-flexible-multiplexing-for-efficient-multiple-llm-serving" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#muxserve-flexible-multiplexing-for-efficient-multiple-llm-serving"><span>MuxServe: Flexible Multiplexing for Efficient Multiple LLM Serving</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Jiangfei Duan, Runyu Lu, Haojie Duanmu, Xiuhong Li, Xingcheng Zhang, Dahua Lin, Ion Stoica, Hao Zhang</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02015v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02015v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Large language models (LLMs) have demon- strated remarkable performance, and organiza- tions are racing to serve LLMs of varying sizes as endpoints for use-cases like chat, programming and search.

The key insight behind is to colocate LLMs considering their popularity to multiplex memory resources, and leverage the characteristics of prefill and decoding phases to separate and flexibly colocate them to multiplex computation resources. MuxServe formally for- mulates the multiplexing problem, and proposes a novel placement algorithm and adaptive batch scheduling strategy to identify optimal coloca- tions and maximize utilization. MuxServe de- signs a unified resource manager to enable flexi- ble and efficient multiplexing.

However, existing single-agent approaches face limitations in generating and improving large-scale, complex codebases due to constraints in context length. To tackle this challenge, we propose Self-Organized multi-Agent framework (SoA), a novel multi-agent framework that enables the scalable and efficient generation and optimization of large-scale code. In SoA, self-organized agents operate independently to generate and modify code components while seamlessly collaborating to construct the overall codebase. A key feature of our framework is the automatic multiplication of agents based on problem complexity, allowing for dynamic scalability. This enables the overall code volume to be increased indefinitely according to the number of agents, while the amount of code managed by each agent remains constant. We evaluate SoA on the HumanEval benchmark and demonstrate that, compared to a single-agent system, each agent in SoA handles significantly less code, yet the overall generated code is substantially greater. Moreover, SoA surpasses the powerful single-agent baseline by 5% in terms of Pass@1 accuracy.</p><h4 id="towards-better-understanding-of-cybercrime-the-role-of-fine-tuned-llms-in-translation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#towards-better-understanding-of-cybercrime-the-role-of-fine-tuned-llms-in-translation"><span>Towards Better Understanding of Cybercrime: The Role of Fine-Tuned LLMs in Translation</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Veronica Valeros, Anna Širokova, Carlos Catania, Sebastian Garcia</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01940v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01940v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Understanding cybercrime communications is paramount for cybersecurity defence.

Existing studies rely on building recommendation models from large-scale users&#39; check-in data, which is task-specific and needs extensive computational resources. Recently, the pretrained large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant advancements in various NLP tasks and have also been investigated for recommendation scenarios. However, the generalization abilities of LLMs still are unexplored to address the next POI recommendations, where users&#39; geographical movement patterns should be extracted. Although there are studies that leverage LLMs for next-item recommendations, they fail to consider the geographical influence and sequential transitions. Hence, they cannot effectively solve the next POI recommendation task. To this end, we design novel prompting strategies and conduct empirical studies to assess the capability of LLMs, e.g., ChatGPT, for predicting a user&#39;s next check-in. Specifically, we consider several essential factors in human movement behaviors, including user geographical preference, spatial distance, and sequential transitions, and formulate the recommendation task as a ranking problem. Through extensive experiments on two widely used real-world datasets, we derive several key findings. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that LLMs have promising zero-shot recommendation abilities and can provide accurate and reasonable predictions. We also reveal that LLMs cannot accurately comprehend geographical context information and are sensitive to the order of presentation of candidate POIs, which shows the limitations of LLMs and necessitates further research on robust human mobility reasoning mechanisms.</p><h4 id="great-now-write-an-article-about-that-the-crescendo-multi-turn-llm-jailbreak-attack" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#great-now-write-an-article-about-that-the-crescendo-multi-turn-llm-jailbreak-attack"><span>Great, Now Write an Article About That: The Crescendo Multi-Turn LLM Jailbreak Attack</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Mark Russinovich, Ahmed Salem, Ronen Eldan</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01833v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01833v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Large Language Models (LLMs) have risen significantly in popularity and are increasingly being adopted across multiple applications. These LLMs are heavily aligned to resist engaging in illegal or unethical topics as a means to avoid contributing to responsible AI harms. However, a recent line of attacks, known as &quot;jailbreaks&quot;, seek to overcome this alignment. Intuitively, jailbreak attacks aim to narrow the gap between what the model can do and what it is willing to do. In this paper, we introduce a novel jailbreak attack called Crescendo. Unlike existing jailbreak methods, Crescendo is a multi-turn jailbreak that interacts with the model in a seemingly benign manner. It begins with a general prompt or question about the task at hand and then gradually escalates the dialogue by referencing the model&#39;s replies, progressively leading to a successful jailbreak. We evaluate Crescendo on various public systems, including ChatGPT, Gemini Pro, Gemini-Ultra, LlaMA-2 70b Chat, and Anthropic Chat. Our results demonstrate the strong efficacy of Crescendo, with it achieving high attack success rates across all evaluated models and tasks. Furthermore, we introduce Crescendomation, a tool that automates the Crescendo attack, and our evaluation showcases its effectiveness against state-of-the-art models.</p><h4 id="transforming-llms-into-cross-modal-and-cross-lingual-retrieval-systems" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#transforming-llms-into-cross-modal-and-cross-lingual-retrieval-systems"><span>Transforming LLMs into Cross-modal and Cross-lingual Retrieval Systems</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Frank Palma Gomez, Ramon Sanabria, Yun-hsuan Sung, Daniel Cer, Siddharth Dalmia, Gustavo Hernandez Abrego</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01616v2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01616v2<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on text-only data that go far beyond the languages with paired speech and text data. At the same time, Dual Encoder (DE) based retrieval systems project queries and documents into the same embedding space and have demonstrated their success in retrieval and bi-text mining. To match speech and text in many languages, we propose using LLMs to initialize multi-modal DE retrieval systems. Unlike traditional methods, our system doesn&#39;t require speech data during LLM pre-training and can exploit LLM&#39;s multilingual text understanding capabilities to match speech and text in languages unseen during retrieval training.

At the same time, Dual Encoder (DE) based retrieval systems project queries and documents into the same embedding space and have demonstrated their success in retrieval and bi-text mining. To match speech and text in many languages, we propose using LLMs to initialize multi-modal DE retrieval systems. Unlike traditional methods, our system doesn&#39;t require speech data during LLM pre-training and can exploit LLM&#39;s multilingual text understanding capabilities to match speech and text in languages unseen during retrieval training. Our multi-modal LLM-based retrieval system is capable of matching speech and text in 102 languages despite only training on 21 languages.

An LLM-based code generator takes a prompt as input and produces code that implements the requirements specified in the prompt. Many software requirements include mathematical formulas that specify the expected behavior of the code to be generated. Given a code generation prompt that includes a mathematical formula, a reasonable expectation is that, if the formula is syntactically modified without changing its semantics, the generated code for the modified prompt should be semantically equivalent. We formalize this concept as syntactic robustness and investigate the syntactic robustness of GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4 as code generators. To test syntactic robustness, we generate syntactically different but semantically equivalent versions of prompts using a set of mutators that only modify mathematical formulas in prompts. In this paper, we focus on prompts that ask for code that generates solutions to variables in an equation, when given coefficients of the equation as input. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4 are not syntactically robust for this type of prompts. To improve syntactic robustness, we define a set of reductions that transform the formulas to a simplified form and use these reductions as a pre-processing step. Our experimental results indicate that the syntactic robustness of LLM-based code generation can be improved using our approach.</p><h4 id="will-the-real-linda-please-stand-up-to-large-language-models-examining-the-representativeness-heuristic-in-llms" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#will-the-real-linda-please-stand-up-to-large-language-models-examining-the-representativeness-heuristic-in-llms"><span>Will the Real Linda Please Stand up...to Large Language Models?

Specifically, LLMs may be susceptible to a common cognitive trap in human decision-making called the representativeness heuristic. This is a concept in psychology that refers to judging the likelihood of an event based on how closely it resembles a well-known prototype or typical example versus considering broader facts or statistical evidence. This work investigates the impact of the representativeness heuristic on LLM reasoning. We created REHEAT (Representativeness Heuristic AI Testing), a dataset containing a series of problems spanning six common types of representativeness heuristics. Experiments reveal that four LLMs applied to REHEAT all exhibited representativeness heuristic biases. We further identify that the model&#39;s reasoning steps are often incorrectly based on a stereotype rather than the problem&#39;s description. Interestingly, the performance improves when adding a hint in the prompt to remind the model of using its knowledge. This suggests the uniqueness of the representativeness heuristic compared to traditional biases. It can occur even when LLMs possess the correct knowledge while failing in a cognitive trap. This highlights the importance of future research focusing on the representativeness heuristic in model reasoning and decision-making and on developing solutions to address it.</p><h4 id="unveiling-divergent-inductive-biases-of-llms-on-temporal-data" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#unveiling-divergent-inductive-biases-of-llms-on-temporal-data"><span>Unveiling Divergent Inductive Biases of LLMs on Temporal Data</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Sindhu Kishore, Hangfeng He</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01453v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01453v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Unraveling the intricate details of events in natural language necessitates a subtle understanding of temporal dynamics. Despite the adeptness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in discerning patterns and relationships from data, their inherent comprehension of temporal dynamics remains a formidable challenge. This research meticulously explores these intrinsic challenges within LLMs, with a specific emphasis on evaluating the performance of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models in the analysis of temporal data. Employing two distinct prompt types, namely Question Answering (QA) format and Textual Entailment (TE) format, our analysis probes into both implicit and explicit events. The findings underscore noteworthy trends, revealing disparities in the performance of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Notably, biases toward specific temporal relationships come to light, with GPT-3.5 demonstrating a preference for &quot;AFTER&#39;&#39; in the QA format for both implicit and explicit events, while GPT-4 leans towards &quot;BEFORE&#39;&#39;. Furthermore, a consistent pattern surfaces wherein GPT-3.5 tends towards &quot;TRUE&#39;&#39;, and GPT-4 exhibits a preference for &quot;FALSE&#39;&#39; in the TE format for both implicit and explicit events. This persistent discrepancy between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 in handling temporal data highlights the intricate nature of inductive bias in LLMs, suggesting that the evolution of these models may not merely mitigate bias but may introduce new layers of complexity.</p><h4 id="position-aware-parameter-efficient-fine-tuning-approach-for-reducing-positional-bias-in-llms" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#position-aware-parameter-efficient-fine-tuning-approach-for-reducing-positional-bias-in-llms"><span>Position-Aware Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning Approach for Reducing Positional Bias in LLMs</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Zheng Zhang, Fan Yang, Ziyan Jiang, Zheng Chen, Zhengyang Zhao, Chengyuan Ma, Liang Zhao, Yang Liu</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01430v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01430v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enhanced their ability to process long input contexts. This development is particularly crucial for tasks that involve retrieving knowledge from an external datastore, which can result in long inputs. However, recent studies show a positional bias in LLMs, demonstrating varying performance depending on the location of useful information within the input sequence. In this study, we conduct extensive experiments to investigate the root causes of positional bias. Our findings indicate that the primary contributor to LLM positional bias stems from the inherent positional preferences of different models. We demonstrate that merely employing prompt-based solutions is inadequate for overcoming the positional preferences. To address this positional bias issue of a pre-trained LLM, we developed a Position-Aware Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PAPEFT) approach which is composed of a data augmentation technique and a parameter efficient adapter, enhancing a uniform attention distribution across the input context. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively reduces positional bias, improving LLMs&#39; effectiveness in handling long context sequences for various tasks that require externally retrieved knowledge.</p><h4 id="a-preliminary-roadmap-for-llms-as-assistants-in-exploring-analyzing-and-visualizing-knowledge-graphs" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#a-preliminary-roadmap-for-llms-as-assistants-in-exploring-analyzing-and-visualizing-knowledge-graphs"><span>A Preliminary Roadmap for LLMs as Assistants in Exploring, Analyzing, and Visualizing Knowledge Graphs</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Harry Li, Gabriel Appleby, Ashley Suh</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01425v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01425v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: We present a mixed-methods study to explore how large language models (LLMs) can assist users in the visual exploration and analysis of knowledge graphs (KGs). We surveyed and interviewed 20 professionals from industry, government laboratories, and academia who regularly work with KGs and LLMs, either collaboratively or concurrently. Our findings show that participants overwhelmingly want an LLM to facilitate data retrieval from KGs through joint query construction, to identify interesting relationships in the KG through multi-turn conversation, and to create on-demand visualizations from the KG that enhance their trust in the LLM&#39;s outputs. To interact with an LLM, participants strongly prefer a chat-based &#39;widget,&#39; built on top of their regular analysis workflows, with the ability to guide the LLM using their interactions with a visualization. When viewing an LLM&#39;s outputs, participants similarly prefer a combination of annotated visuals (e.g., subgraphs or tables extracted from the KG) alongside summarizing text. However, participants also expressed concerns about an LLM&#39;s ability to maintain semantic intent when translating natural language questions into KG queries, the risk of an LLM &#39;hallucinating&#39; false data from the KG, and the difficulties of engineering a &#39;perfect prompt.&#39; From the analysis of our interviews, we contribute a preliminary roadmap for the design of LLM-driven knowledge graph exploration systems and outline future opportunities in this emergent design space.</p><h4 id="prompt-prompted-mixture-of-experts-for-efficient-llm-generation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#prompt-prompted-mixture-of-experts-for-efficient-llm-generation"><span>Prompt-prompted Mixture of Experts for Efficient LLM Generation</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Harry Dong, Beidi Chen, Yuejie Chi</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01365v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01365v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: With the development of transformer-based large language models (LLMs), they have been applied to many fields due to their remarkable utility, but this comes at a considerable computational cost at deployment. Fortunately, some methods such as pruning or constructing a mixture of experts (MoE) aim at exploiting sparsity in transformer feedforward (FF) blocks to gain boosts in speed and reduction in memory requirements. However, these techniques can be very costly and inflexible in practice, as they often require training or are restricted to specific types of architectures. To address this, we introduce GRIFFIN, a novel training-free MoE that selects unique FF experts at the sequence level for efficient generation across a plethora of LLMs with different non-ReLU activation functions. This is possible due to a critical observation that many trained LLMs naturally produce highly structured FF activation patterns within a sequence, which we call flocking. Despite our method&#39;s simplicity, we show with 50% of the FF parameters, GRIFFIN maintains the original model&#39;s performance with little to no degradation on a variety of classification and generation tasks, all while improving latency (e.g. 1.25$\times$ speed-up in Llama 2 13B on an NVIDIA L40).

Recently, there has been immense speculation about how many people are using large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT in their academic writing, and to what extent this tool might have an effect on global scientific practices. However, we lack a precise measure of the proportion of academic writing substantially modified or produced by LLMs. To address this gap, we conduct the first systematic, large-scale analysis across 950,965 papers published between January 2020 and February 2024 on the arXiv, bioRxiv, and Nature portfolio journals, using a population-level statistical framework to measure the prevalence of LLM-modified content over time. Our statistical estimation operates on the corpus level and is more robust than inference on individual instances. Our findings reveal a steady increase in LLM usage, with the largest and fastest growth observed in Computer Science papers (up to 17.5%). In comparison, Mathematics papers and the Nature portfolio showed the least LLM modification (up to 6.3%). Moreover, at an aggregate level, our analysis reveals that higher levels of LLM-modification are associated with papers whose first authors post preprints more frequently, papers in more crowded research areas, and papers of shorter lengths.

By enabling fine-grained identification and interaction with specific parts of an object, it significantly improves the system&#39;s ability to provide contextually relevant and spatially accurate responses, crucial for applications in dynamic environments like robotics and augmented reality. However, traditional systems face challenges in accurately mapping objects within images to generate nuanced and spatially aware responses. In this work, we introduce &quot;Detect2Interact&quot;, which addresses these challenges by introducing an advanced approach for fine-grained object visual key field detection. First, we use the segment anything model (SAM) to generate detailed spatial maps of objects in images. Next, we use Vision Studio to extract semantic object descriptions. Third, we employ GPT-4&#39;s common sense knowledge, bridging the gap between an object&#39;s semantics and its spatial map. As a result, Detect2Interact achieves consistent qualitative results on object key field detection across extensive test cases and outperforms the existing VQA system with object detection by providing a more reasonable and finer visual representation.</p><h4 id="do-llms-find-human-answers-to-fact-driven-questions-perplexing-a-case-study-on-reddit" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#do-llms-find-human-answers-to-fact-driven-questions-perplexing-a-case-study-on-reddit"><span>Do LLMs Find Human Answers To Fact-Driven Questions Perplexing?

We collect and release a dataset of 409 fact-driven questions and 7,534 diverse, human-rated answers from 15 r/Ask{Topic} communities across 3 categories: profession, social identity, and geographic location. We find that LLMs are considerably better at modeling highly-rated human answers to such questions, as opposed to poorly-rated human answers.

Trainable evaluation metrics are commonly trained with true positive and randomly selected negative responses, resulting in a tendency for them to assign a higher score to the responses that share higher content similarity with a given context. However, adversarial negative responses possess high content similarity with the contexts whilst being semantically different. Therefore, existing evaluation metrics are not robust enough to evaluate such responses, resulting in low correlations with human judgments. While recent studies have shown some efficacy in utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for open-domain dialogue evaluation, they still encounter challenges in effectively handling adversarial negative examples. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective framework for open-domain dialogue evaluation, which combines domain-specific language models (SLMs) with LLMs. The SLMs can explicitly incorporate Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graph information of the dialogue through a gating mechanism for enhanced semantic representation learning. The evaluation result of SLMs and AMR graph information are plugged into the prompt of LLM, for the enhanced in-context learning performance. Experimental results on open-domain dialogue evaluation tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to a wide range of state-of-the-art baselines, especially in discriminating adversarial negative responses.

One method of removing such violations by construction is to port C code to a safe C dialect. Such dialects rely on programmer-supplied annotations to guarantee safety with minimal runtime overhead. This porting, however, is a manual process that imposes significant burden on the programmer and, hence, there has been limited adoption of this technique. The task of porting not only requires inferring annotations, but may also need refactoring/rewriting of the code to make it amenable to such annotations. In this paper, we use Large Language Models (LLMs) towards addressing both these concerns. We show how to harness LLM capabilities to do complex code reasoning as well as rewriting of large codebases. We also present a novel framework for whole-program transformations that leverages lightweight static analysis to break the transformation into smaller steps that can be carried out effectively by an LLM. We implement our ideas in a tool called MSA that targets the CheckedC dialect. We evaluate MSA on several micro-benchmarks, as well as real-world code ranging up to 20K lines of code. We showcase superior performance compared to a vanilla LLM baseline, as well as demonstrate improvement over a state-of-the-art symbolic (non-LLM) technique.</p><h4 id="can-llms-get-help-from-other-llms-without-revealing-private-information" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#can-llms-get-help-from-other-llms-without-revealing-private-information"><span>Can LLMs get help from other LLMs without revealing private information?</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Florian Hartmann, Duc-Hieu Tran, Peter Kairouz, Victor Cărbune, Blaise Aguera y Arcas</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01041v2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01041v2<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Cascades are a common type of machine learning systems in which a large, remote model can be queried if a local model is not able to accurately label a user&#39;s data by itself. Serving stacks for large language models (LLMs) increasingly use cascades due to their ability to preserve task performance while dramatically reducing inference costs. However, applying cascade systems in situations where the local model has access to sensitive data constitutes a significant privacy risk for users since such data could be forwarded to the remote model. In this work, we show the feasibility of applying cascade systems in such setups by equipping the local model with privacy-preserving techniques that reduce the risk of leaking private information when querying the remote model. To quantify information leakage in such setups, we introduce two privacy measures. We then propose a system that leverages the recently introduced social learning paradigm in which LLMs collaboratively learn from each other by exchanging natural language. Using this paradigm, we demonstrate on several datasets that our methods minimize the privacy loss while at the same time improving task performance compared to a non-cascade baseline.</p><h4 id="efficiently-distilling-llms-for-edge-applications" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#efficiently-distilling-llms-for-edge-applications"><span>Efficiently Distilling LLMs for Edge Applications</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Achintya Kundu, Fabian Lim, Aaron Chew, Laura Wynter, Penny Chong, Rhui Dih Lee</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01353v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01353v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Supernet training of LLMs is of great interest in industrial applications as it confers the ability to produce a palette of smaller models at constant cost, regardless of the number of models (of different size / latency) produced.

Despite the promising performance, LLMs are prone to generate hallucinations, which means LLMs might produce outputs that deviate from users&#39; intent, exhibit internal inconsistencies, or misalign with the factual knowledge, making the deployment of LLMs potentially risky in a wide range of applications. Existing work mainly focuses on investing the hallucination in the domain of natural language generation (NLG), leaving a gap in understanding the types and extent of hallucinations in the context of code generation. To bridge the gap, we conducted a thematic analysis of the LLM-generated code to summarize and categorize the hallucinations present in it. Our study established a comprehensive taxonomy of hallucinations in LLM-generated code, encompassing 5 primary categories of hallucinations depending on the conflicting objectives and varying degrees of deviation observed in code generation. Furthermore, we systematically analyzed the distribution of hallucinations, exploring variations among different LLMs and their correlation with code correctness. Based on the results, we proposed HalluCode, a benchmark for evaluating the performance of code LLMs in recognizing hallucinations. Hallucination recognition and mitigation experiments with HalluCode and HumanEval show existing LLMs face great challenges in recognizing hallucinations, particularly in identifying their types, and are hardly able to mitigate hallucinations. We believe our findings will shed light on future research about hallucination evaluation, detection, and mitigation, ultimately paving the way for building more effective and reliable code LLMs in the future.</p><h4 id="llms-are-good-sign-language-translators" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#llms-are-good-sign-language-translators"><span>LLMs are Good Sign Language Translators</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Jia Gong, Lin Geng Foo, Yixuan He, Hossein Rahmani, Jun Liu</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00925v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00925v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Sign Language Translation (SLT) is a challenging task that aims to translate sign videos into spoken language.

In this paper, we regularize the sign videos to embody linguistic characteristics of spoken language, and propose a novel SignLLM framework to transform sign videos into a language-like representation for improved readability by off-the-shelf LLMs. SignLLM comprises two key modules: (1) The Vector-Quantized Visual Sign module converts sign videos into a sequence of discrete character-level sign tokens, and (2) the Codebook Reconstruction and Alignment module converts these character-level tokens into word-level sign representations using an optimal transport formulation. A sign-text alignment loss further bridges the gap between sign and text tokens, enhancing semantic compatibility.

Previous research has primarily focused on classifying text as either entirely human-written or LLM-generated, neglecting the detection of mixed texts that contain both types of content. This paper explores LLMs&#39; ability to identify boundaries in human-written and machine-generated mixed texts. We approach this task by transforming it into a token classification problem and regard the label turning point as the boundary. Notably, our ensemble model of LLMs achieved first place in the &#39;Human-Machine Mixed Text Detection&#39; sub-task of the SemEval&#39;24 Competition Task 8. Additionally, we investigate factors that influence the capability of LLMs in detecting boundaries within mixed texts, including the incorporation of extra layers on top of LLMs, combination of segmentation loss, and the impact of pretraining. Our findings aim to provide valuable insights for future research in this area.</p><h2 id="_2024-03-31" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2024-03-31"><span>2024-03-31</span></a></h2><h4 id="the-larger-the-better-improved-llm-code-generation-via-budget-reallocation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-larger-the-better-improved-llm-code-generation-via-budget-reallocation"><span>The Larger the Better?

However, larger models also require significantly more time and compute during inference. This begs the question: what happens when both models operate under the same budget? (e.g., compute, run-time). To address this question, we analyze code generation LLMs of various sizes and make comparisons such as running a 70B model once vs. generating five outputs from a 13B model and selecting one. Our findings reveal that, in a standard unit-test setup, the repeated use of smaller models can yield consistent improvements, with gains of up to 15% across five tasks. On the other hand, in scenarios where unit-tests are unavailable, a ranking-based selection of candidates from the smaller model falls short of the performance of a single output from larger ones.

However, most research has focused on improving model accuracy through prompt engineering, prompt learning, or fine-tuning with limited labeled data, thereby overlooking the importance of refining the class descriptors. This paper introduces a new approach to text-supervised semantic segmentation using supervision by a large language model (LLM) that does not require extra training. Our method starts from an LLM, like GPT-3, to generate a detailed set of subclasses for more accurate class representation. We then employ an advanced text-supervised semantic segmentation model to apply the generated subclasses as target labels, resulting in diverse segmentation results tailored to each subclass&#39;s unique characteristics. Additionally, we propose an assembly that merges the segmentation maps from the various subclass descriptors to ensure a more comprehensive representation of the different aspects in the test images. Through comprehensive experiments on three standard benchmarks, our method outperforms traditional text-supervised semantic segmentation methods by a marked margin.</p><h4 id="how-much-are-llms-contaminated-a-comprehensive-survey-and-the-llmsanitize-library" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-much-are-llms-contaminated-a-comprehensive-survey-and-the-llmsanitize-library"><span>How Much are LLMs Contaminated?

Business applications and fundraising in AI have reached a scale at which a few percentage points gained on popular question-answering benchmarks could translate into dozens of millions of dollars, placing high pressure on model integrity. At the same time, it is becoming harder and harder to keep track of the data that LLMs have seen; if not impossible with closed-source models like GPT-4 and Claude-3 not divulging any information on the training set. As a result, contamination becomes a critical issue: LLMs&#39; performance may not be reliable anymore, as the high performance may be at least partly due to their previous exposure to the data. This limitation jeopardizes the entire progress in the field of NLP, yet, there remains a lack of methods on how to efficiently address contamination, or a clear consensus on prevention, mitigation and classification of contamination. In this paper, we survey all recent work on contamination with LLMs, and help the community track contamination levels of LLMs by releasing an open-source Python library named LLMSanitize implementing major contamination detection algorithms, which link is: https://github.com/ntunlp/LLMSanitize.</p><h4 id="llm-meets-vision-language-models-for-zero-shot-one-class-classification" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#llm-meets-vision-language-models-for-zero-shot-one-class-classification"><span>LLM meets Vision-Language Models for Zero-Shot One-Class Classification</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Yassir Bendou, Giulia Lioi, Bastien Pasdeloup, Lukas Mauch, Ghouthi Boukli Hacene, Fabien Cardinaux, Vincent Gripon</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00675v2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00675v2<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: We consider the problem of zero-shot one-class visual classification. In this setting, only the label of the target class is available, and the goal is to discriminate between positive and negative query samples without requiring any validation example from the target task. We propose a two-step solution that first queries large language models for visually confusing objects and then relies on vision-language pre-trained models (e.g., CLIP) to perform classification. By adapting large-scale vision benchmarks, we demonstrate the ability of the proposed method to outperform adapted off-the-shelf alternatives in this setting. Namely, we propose a realistic benchmark where negative query samples are drawn from the same original dataset as positive ones, including a granularity-controlled version of iNaturalist, where negative samples are at a fixed distance in the taxonomy tree from the positive ones.

However, diagnosing these errors is challenging due to the vast and complex configuration space. These errors pose significant challenges for both experienced maintainers and new end-users, particularly those without access to the source code of the software systems. Given that logs are easily accessible to most end-users, we conduct a preliminary study to outline the challenges and opportunities of utilizing logs in localizing configuration errors. Based on the insights gained from the preliminary study, we propose an LLM-based two-stage strategy for end-users to localize the root-cause configuration properties based on logs. We further implement a tool, LogConfigLocalizer, aligned with the design of the aforementioned strategy, hoping to assist end-users in coping with configuration errors through log analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to localize the root-cause configuration properties for end-users based on Large Language Models~(LLMs) and logs. We evaluate the proposed strategy on Hadoop by LogConfigLocalizer and prove its efficiency with an average accuracy as high as 99.91%. Additionally, we also demonstrate the effectiveness and necessity of different phases of the methodology by comparing it with two other variants and a baseline tool. Moreover, we validate the proposed methodology through a practical case study to demonstrate its effectiveness and feasibility.</p><h4 id="ai-act-and-large-language-models-llms-when-critical-issues-and-privacy-impact-require-human-and-ethical-oversight" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ai-act-and-large-language-models-llms-when-critical-issues-and-privacy-impact-require-human-and-ethical-oversight"><span>AI Act and Large Language Models (LLMs): When critical issues and privacy impact require human and ethical oversight</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Nicola Fabiano</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00600v2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00600v2<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: The imposing evolution of artificial intelligence systems and, specifically, of Large Language Models (LLM) makes it necessary to carry out assessments of their level of risk and the impact they may have in the area of privacy, personal data protection and at an ethical level, especially on the weakest and most vulnerable.

Moreover, existing API integrations emphasize diversity over the precision and error avoidance essential in real-world customer service scenarios. To address these issues, we propose an LLM agent named CHOPS (CHat with custOmer Profile in existing System), designed to: (1) efficiently utilize existing databases or systems for accessing user information or interacting with these systems following existing guidelines; (2) provide accurate and reasonable responses or carry out required operations in the system while avoiding harmful operations; and (3) leverage a combination of small and large LLMs to achieve satisfying performance at a reasonable inference cost. We introduce a practical dataset, the CPHOS-dataset, which includes a database, guiding files, and QA pairs collected from CPHOS, an online platform that facilitates the organization of simulated Physics Olympiads for high school teachers and students. We have conducted extensive experiments to validate the performance of our proposed CHOPS architecture using the CPHOS-dataset, with the aim of demonstrating how LLMs can enhance or serve as alternatives to human customer service.

Among them, some works use large model architectures as backbones of their recognizers to boost the skeleton data representation capability, while some other works pre-train their recognizers on external data to enrich the knowledge. In this work, we observe that large language models which have been extensively used in various natural language processing tasks generally hold both large model architectures and rich implicit knowledge. Motivated by this, we propose a novel LLM-AR framework, in which we investigate treating the Large Language Model as an Action Recognizer. In our framework, we propose a linguistic projection process to project each input action signal (i.e., each skeleton sequence) into its <code>sentence format&#39;&#39; (i.e., an </code>action sentence&#39;&#39;). Moreover, we also incorporate our framework with several designs to further facilitate this linguistic projection process.

While existing alignment methods like RLHF, DPO, etc., effectively fine-tune LLMs to match preferences in the preference dataset, they often lead LLMs to highly receptive human input and external evidence, even when this information is poisoned. This leads to a tendency for LLMs to be Adaptive Chameleons when external evidence conflicts with their parametric memory. This exacerbates the risk of LLM being attacked by external poisoned data, which poses a significant security risk to LLM system applications such as Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). To address the challenge, we propose a novel framework: Dialectical Alignment (DA), which (1) utilizes AI feedback to identify optimal strategies for LLMs to navigate inter-context conflicts and context-memory conflicts with different external evidence in context window (i.e., different ratios of poisoned factual contexts); (2) constructs the SFT dataset as well as the preference dataset based on the AI feedback and strategies above; (3) uses the above datasets for LLM alignment to defense poisoned context attack while preserving the effectiveness of in-context knowledge editing. Our experiments show that the dialectical alignment model improves poisoned data attack defense by 20 and does not require any additional prompt engineering or prior declaration of <code>you may be attacked</code> to the LLMs&#39; context window.</p><h4 id="numerologic-number-encoding-for-enhanced-llms-numerical-reasoning" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#numerologic-number-encoding-for-enhanced-llms-numerical-reasoning"><span>NumeroLogic: Number Encoding for Enhanced LLMs&#39; Numerical Reasoning</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Eli Schwartz, Leshem Choshen, Joseph Shtok, Sivan Doveh, Leonid Karlinsky, Assaf Arbelle</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00459v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00459v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Language models struggle with handling numerical data and performing arithmetic operations. We hypothesize that this limitation can be partially attributed to non-intuitive textual numbers representation. When a digit is read or generated by a causal language model it does not know its place value (e.g. thousands vs. hundreds) until the entire number is processed. To address this issue, we propose a simple adjustment to how numbers are represented by including the count of digits before each number. For instance, instead of &quot;42&quot;, we suggest using &quot;{2:42}&quot; as the new format. This approach, which we term NumeroLogic, offers an added advantage in number generation by serving as a Chain of Thought (CoT). By requiring the model to consider the number of digits first, it enhances the reasoning process before generating the actual number. We use arithmetic tasks to demonstrate the effectiveness of the NumeroLogic formatting. We further demonstrate NumeroLogic applicability to general natural language modeling, improving language understanding performance in the MMLU benchmark.</p><h4 id="metaie-distilling-a-meta-model-from-llm-for-all-kinds-of-information-extraction-tasks" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#metaie-distilling-a-meta-model-from-llm-for-all-kinds-of-information-extraction-tasks"><span>MetaIE: Distilling a Meta Model from LLM for All Kinds of Information Extraction Tasks</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Letian Peng, Zilong Wang, Feng Yao, Zihan Wang, Jingbo Shang</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00457v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00457v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Information extraction (IE) is a fundamental area in natural language processing where prompting large language models (LLMs), even with in-context examples, cannot defeat small LMs tuned on very small IE datasets. We observe that IE tasks, such as named entity recognition and relation extraction, all focus on extracting important information, which can be formalized as a label-to-span matching. In this paper, we propose a novel framework MetaIE to build a small LM as meta-model by learning to extract &quot;important information&quot;, i.e., the meta-understanding of IE, so that this meta-model can be adapted to all kind of IE tasks effectively and efficiently. Specifically, MetaIE obtains the small LM via a symbolic distillation from an LLM following the label-to-span scheme. We construct the distillation dataset via sampling sentences from language model pre-training datasets (e.g., OpenWebText in our implementation) and prompting an LLM to identify the typed spans of &quot;important information&quot;. We evaluate the meta-model under the few-shot adaptation setting. Extensive results on 13 datasets from 6 IE tasks confirm that MetaIE can offer a better starting point for few-shot tuning on IE datasets and outperform other meta-models from (1) vanilla language model pre-training, (2) multi-IE-task pre-training with human annotations, and (3) single-IE-task symbolic distillation from LLM. Moreover, we provide comprehensive analyses of MetaIE, such as the size of the distillation dataset, the meta-model architecture, and the size of the meta-model.</p><h4 id="quarot-outlier-free-4-bit-inference-in-rotated-llms" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#quarot-outlier-free-4-bit-inference-in-rotated-llms"><span>QuaRot: Outlier-Free 4-Bit Inference in Rotated LLMs</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Saleh Ashkboos, Amirkeivan Mohtashami, Maximilian L.

QuaRot rotates LLMs in a way that removes outliers from the hidden state without changing the output, making quantization easier. This computational invariance is applied to the hidden state (residual) of the LLM, as well as to the activations of the feed-forward components, aspects of the attention mechanism and to the KV cache. The result is a quantized model where all matrix multiplications are performed in 4-bits, without any channels identified for retention in higher precision.

However, its effectiveness is limited for more complex tasks involving reasoning, creativity, and iteration. Through a systematic analysis of HCI papers published since 2021, we identified four key phases in the human-LLM interaction flow - planning, facilitating, iterating, and testing - to precisely understand the dynamics of this process. Additionally, we have developed a taxonomy of four primary interaction modes: Mode 1: Standard Prompting, Mode 2: User Interface, Mode 3: Context-based, and Mode 4: Agent Facilitator. This taxonomy was further enriched using the &quot;5W1H&quot; guideline method, which involved a detailed examination of definitions, participant roles (Who), the phases that happened (When), human objectives and LLM abilities (What), and the mechanics of each interaction mode (How). We anticipate this taxonomy will contribute to the future design and evaluation of human-LLM interaction.</p><h4 id="can-llms-master-math-investigating-large-language-models-on-math-stack-exchange" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#can-llms-master-math-investigating-large-language-models-on-math-stack-exchange"><span>Can LLMs Master Math?

Despite these advancements, the domain of mathematics presents a distinctive challenge, primarily due to its specialized structure and the precision it demands. In this study, we adopted a two-step approach for investigating the proficiency of LLMs in answering mathematical questions. First, we employ the most effective LLMs, as identified by their performance on math question-answer benchmarks, to generate answers to 78 questions from the Math Stack Exchange (MSE). Second, a case analysis is conducted on the LLM that showed the highest performance, focusing on the quality and accuracy of its answers through manual evaluation. We found that GPT-4 performs best (nDCG of 0.48 and P@10 of 0.37) amongst existing LLMs fine-tuned for answering mathematics questions and outperforms the current best approach on ArqMATH3 Task1, considering P@10. Our Case analysis indicates that while the GPT-4 can generate relevant responses in certain instances, it does not consistently answer all questions accurately. This paper explores the current limitations of LLMs in navigating complex mathematical problem-solving. Through case analysis, we shed light on the gaps in LLM capabilities within mathematics, thereby setting the stage for future research and advancements in AI-driven mathematical reasoning.

Traditional methodologies for annotating datasets for NER models are challenged by high costs and variations in dataset quality. This research introduces a novel hybrid annotation approach that synergizes human effort with the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). This approach not only aims to ameliorate the noise inherent in manual annotations, such as omissions, thereby enhancing the performance of NER models, but also achieves this in a cost-effective manner. Additionally, by employing a label mixing strategy, it addresses the issue of class imbalance encountered in LLM-based annotations. Through an analysis across multiple datasets, this method has been consistently shown to provide superior performance compared to traditional annotation methods, even under constrained budget conditions. This study illuminates the potential of leveraging LLMs to improve dataset quality, introduces a novel technique to mitigate class imbalances, and demonstrates the feasibility of achieving high-performance NER in a cost-effective way.</p><h4 id="a-comprehensive-study-on-nlp-data-augmentation-for-hate-speech-detection-legacy-methods-bert-and-llms" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#a-comprehensive-study-on-nlp-data-augmentation-for-hate-speech-detection-legacy-methods-bert-and-llms"><span>A Comprehensive Study on NLP Data Augmentation for Hate Speech Detection: Legacy Methods, BERT, and LLMs</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Md Saroar Jahan, Mourad Oussalah, Djamila Romaissa Beddia, Jhuma kabir Mim, Nabil Arhab</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00303v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00303v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: The surge of interest in data augmentation within the realm of NLP has been driven by the need to address challenges posed by hate speech domains, the dynamic nature of social media vocabulary, and the demands for large-scale neural networks requiring extensive training data. However, the prevalent use of lexical substitution in data augmentation has raised concerns, as it may inadvertently alter the intended meaning, thereby impacting the efficacy of supervised machine learning models. In pursuit of suitable data augmentation methods, this study explores both established legacy approaches and contemporary practices such as Large Language Models (LLM), including GPT in Hate Speech detection. Additionally, we propose an optimized utilization of BERT-based encoder models with contextual cosine similarity filtration, exposing significant limitations in prior synonym substitution methods. Our comparative analysis encompasses five popular augmentation techniques: WordNet and Fast-Text synonym replacement, Back-translation, BERT-mask contextual augmentation, and LLM. Our analysis across five benchmarked datasets revealed that while traditional methods like back-translation show low label alteration rates (0.3-1.5%), and BERT-based contextual synonym replacement offers sentence diversity but at the cost of higher label alteration rates (over 6%). Our proposed BERT-based contextual cosine similarity filtration markedly reduced label alteration to just 0.05%, demonstrating its efficacy in 0.7% higher F1 performance. However, augmenting data with GPT-3 not only avoided overfitting with up to sevenfold data increase but also improved embedding space coverage by 15% and classification F1 score by 1.4% over traditional methods, and by 0.8% over our method.</p><h4 id="secret-keepers-the-impact-of-llms-on-linguistic-markers-of-personal-traits" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#secret-keepers-the-impact-of-llms-on-linguistic-markers-of-personal-traits"><span>Secret Keepers: The Impact of LLMs on Linguistic Markers of Personal Traits</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Zhivar Sourati, Meltem Ozcan, Colin McDaniel, Alireza Ziabari, Nuan Wen, Ala Tak, Fred Morstatter, Morteza Dehghani</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00267v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00267v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Prior research has established associations between individuals&#39; language usage and their personal traits; our linguistic patterns reveal information about our personalities, emotional states, and beliefs.

We investigate the impact of LLMs on the linguistic markers of demographic and psychological traits, specifically examining three LLMs - GPT3.5, Llama 2, and Gemini - across six different traits: gender, age, political affiliation, personality, empathy, and morality. Our findings indicate that although the use of LLMs slightly reduces the predictive power of linguistic patterns over authors&#39; personal traits, the significant changes are infrequent, and the use of LLMs does not fully diminish the predictive power of authors&#39; linguistic patterns over their personal traits. We also note that some theoretically established lexical-based linguistic markers lose their reliability as predictors when LLMs are used in the writing process.

Depending on the guidance signal, it searches for the best path from root to leaf in the tree by forming LLM outputs to improve controllability, reasoning ability, alignment, et cetera. However, current tree decoding strategies and their inference systems do not suit each other well due to redundancy in computation, memory footprints, and memory access, resulting in inefficient inference. To address this issue, we propose DeFT, an IO-aware tree attention algorithm that maintains memory-efficient attention calculation with low memory footprints in two stages: (1) QKV Preparation: we propose a KV-Guided Tree Split strategy to group QKV wisely for high utilization of GPUs and reduction of memory reads/writes for the KV cache between GPU global memory and on-chip shared memory as much as possible; (2) Attention Calculation: we calculate partial attention of each QKV groups in a fused kernel then apply a Tree-topology-aware Global Reduction strategy to get final attention. Thanks to a reduction in KV cache IO by 3.6-4.5$\times$, along with an additional reduction in IO for $\mathbf{Q} \mathbf{K}^\top$ and Softmax equivalent to 25% of the total KV cache IO, DeFT can achieve a speedup of 1.7-2.4$\times$ in end-to-end latency across two practical reasoning tasks over the SOTA attention algorithms.</p><h4 id="is-factuality-decoding-a-free-lunch-for-llms-evaluation-on-knowledge-editing-benchmark" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#is-factuality-decoding-a-free-lunch-for-llms-evaluation-on-knowledge-editing-benchmark"><span>Is Factuality Decoding a Free Lunch for LLMs?

Extensive efforts have been made to reduce factual hallucinations by modifying LLMs with factuality decoding. However, they also pose risks of hindering knowledge updates, as they make models overly confident in known facts. In this work, we first revisite the current factuality decoding methods and verified their effectiveness in enhancing factual accuracy. Subsequently, we conduct further evaluation of several strong factuality decoding methods on the knowledge editing benchmark. All these decoding methods significantly diminish the performance of llama2 models compared to their original decoding, with the largest decrease being a staggering 81.3%. This further indicates that the current existing decoding methods still cannot perfectly address the factual hallucinations, as they overlook the importance of preserving the flexibility for knowledge editing. Therefore, our work suggests that research into factual alignment should simultaneously focus on the effectiveness of knowledge editing.</p><h2 id="_2024-03-29" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2024-03-29"><span>2024-03-29</span></a></h2><h4 id="towards-greener-llms-bringing-energy-efficiency-to-the-forefront-of-llm-inference" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#towards-greener-llms-bringing-energy-efficiency-to-the-forefront-of-llm-inference"><span>Towards Greener LLMs: Bringing Energy-Efficiency to the Forefront of LLM Inference</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Jovan Stojkovic, Esha Choukse, Chaojie Zhang, Inigo Goiri, Josep Torrellas</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20306v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20306v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: With the ubiquitous use of modern large language models (LLMs) across industries, the inference serving for these models is ever expanding.

Energy availability has come to the forefront as the biggest challenge for data center expansion to serve these models. In this paper, we present the trade-offs brought up by making energy efficiency the primary goal of LLM serving under performance SLOs. We show that depending on the inputs, the model, and the service-level agreements, there are several knobs available to the LLM inference provider to use for being energy efficient. We characterize the impact of these knobs on the latency, throughput, as well as the energy. By exploring these trade-offs, we offer valuable insights into optimizing energy usage without compromising on performance, thereby paving the way for sustainable and cost-effective LLM deployment in data center environments.</p><h4 id="can-llms-correct-physicians-yet-investigating-effective-interaction-methods-in-the-medical-domain" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#can-llms-correct-physicians-yet-investigating-effective-interaction-methods-in-the-medical-domain"><span>Can LLMs Correct Physicians, Yet?

We consider questions from PubMedQA and several tasks, ranging from binary (yes/no) responses to long answer generation, where the answer of the model is produced after an interaction with a physician. Our findings suggest that prompt design significantly influences the downstream accuracy of LLMs and that LLMs can provide valuable feedback to physicians, challenging incorrect diagnoses and contributing to more accurate decision-making. For example, when the physician is accurate 38% of the time, Mistral can produce the correct answer, improving accuracy up to 74% depending on the prompt being used, while Llama2 and Meditron models exhibit greater sensitivity to prompt choice.

Despite their effectiveness, these models are prone to generate nonfactual content. Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is pivotal in enhancing our understanding of a model&#39;s confidence in its generated content, thereby aiding in the mitigation of nonfactual outputs. Existing research on UQ predominantly targets short text generation, typically yielding brief, word-limited responses. However, real-world applications frequently necessitate much longer responses. Our study first highlights the limitations of current UQ methods in handling long text generation. We then introduce \textsc{Luq}, a novel sampling-based UQ approach specifically designed for long text. Our findings reveal that \textsc{Luq} outperforms existing baseline methods in correlating with the model&#39;s factuality scores (negative coefficient of -0.85 observed for Gemini Pro). With \textsc{Luq} as the tool for UQ, we investigate behavior patterns of several popular LLMs&#39; response confidence spectrum and how that interplays with the response&#39; factuality. We identify that LLMs lack confidence in generating long text for rare facts and a factually strong model (i.e. GPT-4) tends to reject questions it is not sure about. To further improve the factual accuracy of LLM responses, we propose a method called \textsc{Luq-Ensemble} that ensembles responses from multiple models and selects the response with the least uncertainty. The ensembling method greatly improves the response factuality upon the best standalone LLM.</p><h4 id="using-llms-to-model-the-beliefs-and-preferences-of-targeted-populations" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#using-llms-to-model-the-beliefs-and-preferences-of-targeted-populations"><span>Using LLMs to Model the Beliefs and Preferences of Targeted Populations</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Keiichi Namikoshi, Alex Filipowicz, David A.

We benchmark and evaluate two well-known fine-tuning approaches and evaluate the resulting populations on their ability to match the preferences of real human respondents on a survey of preferences for battery electric vehicles (BEVs).

It made evident the colossal shortage of dedicated hardware capable of efficient and fast processing of the involved compute and memory movement. The problem is aggravated by the exploding raise in the lengths of the sequences being processed, since those require efficient on-chip storage of the KV-cache of size proportional to the sequence length. To make the required compute feasible and fit the involved data into available memory, numerous quantization techniques have been proposed that allow accurate quantization for both weights and activations. One of the main recent breakthroughs in this direction was introduction of the family of Block Floating Point (BFP) formats characterized by a block of mantissas with a shared scale factor. These enable memory- power-, and compute- efficient hardware support of the tensor operations and provide extremely good quantization accuracy. The main issues preventing widespread application of block formats is caused by the presence of outliers in weights and activations since those affect the accuracy of the other values in the same block. In this paper, we focus on the most critical problem of limited KV-cache storage. We propose a novel approach enabling usage of low precision BFP formats without compromising the resulting model accuracy. We exploit the common channel-wise patterns exhibited by the outliers to rearrange them in such a way, that their quantization quality is significantly improved. The methodology yields 2x savings in the memory footprint without significant degradation of the model&#39;s accuracy. Importantly, the rearrangement of channels happens at the compile time and thus has no impact on the inference latency.</p><h4 id="can-llms-learn-from-previous-mistakes-investigating-llms-errors-to-boost-for-reasoning" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#can-llms-learn-from-previous-mistakes-investigating-llms-errors-to-boost-for-reasoning"><span>Can LLMs Learn from Previous Mistakes?

While humans can indeed imitate correct examples, learning from our mistakes is another vital aspect of human cognition. Hence, a question naturally arises: \textit{can LLMs learn and benefit from their mistakes, especially for their reasoning? } This study investigates this problem from both the prompting and model-tuning perspectives. We begin by introducing \textsc{CoTErrorSet}, a new benchmark with 609,432 questions, each designed with both correct and error references, and demonstrating the types and reasons for making such mistakes. To explore the effectiveness of those mistakes, we design two methods: (1) \textbf{Self-rethinking} prompting guides LLMs to rethink whether they have made similar previous mistakes; and (2) \textbf{Mistake tuning} involves finetuning models in both correct and incorrect reasoning domains, rather than only tuning models to learn ground truth in traditional methodology. We conduct a series of experiments to prove LLMs can obtain benefits from mistakes in both directions. Our two methods offer potentially cost-effective strategies by leveraging errors to enhance reasoning capabilities, which costs significantly less than creating meticulously hand-crafted golden references. We ultimately make a thorough analysis of the reasons behind LLMs&#39; errors, which provides directions that future research needs to overcome. \textsc{CoTErrorSet} will be published soon on \texttt{Anonymity Link}.</p><h4 id="enhancing-the-general-agent-capabilities-of-low-parameter-llms-through-tuning-and-multi-branch-reasoning" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#enhancing-the-general-agent-capabilities-of-low-parameter-llms-through-tuning-and-multi-branch-reasoning"><span>Enhancing the General Agent Capabilities of Low-Parameter LLMs through Tuning and Multi-Branch Reasoning</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Qinhao Zhou, Zihan Zhang, Xiang Xiang, Ke Wang, Yuchuan Wu, Yongbin Li</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19962v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19962v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Open-source pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong language understanding and generation capabilities, making them highly successful in a variety of tasks. However, when used as agents for dealing with complex problems in the real world, their performance is far inferior to large commercial models such as ChatGPT and GPT-4. As intelligent agents, LLMs need to have the capabilities of task planning, long-term memory, and the ability to leverage external tools to achieve satisfactory performance. Various methods have been proposed to enhance the agent capabilities of LLMs. On the one hand, methods involve constructing agent-specific data and fine-tuning the models. On the other hand, some methods focus on designing prompts that effectively activate the reasoning abilities of the LLMs. We explore both strategies on the 7B and 13B models. We propose a comprehensive method for constructing agent-specific data using GPT-4. Through supervised fine-tuning with constructed data, we find that for these models with a relatively small number of parameters, supervised fine-tuning can significantly reduce hallucination outputs and formatting errors in agent tasks. Furthermore, techniques such as multi-path reasoning and task decomposition can effectively decrease problem complexity and enhance the performance of LLMs as agents.

These models, however, come with well-known ethical issues, which may manifest in unexpected ways in human-computer interaction research due to the extensive engagement with human subjects. This paper reports on research practices related to LLM use, drawing on 16 semi-structured interviews and a survey conducted with 50 HCI researchers. We discuss the ways in which LLMs are already being utilized throughout the entire HCI research pipeline, from ideation to system development and paper writing. While researchers described nuanced understandings of ethical issues, they were rarely or only partially able to identify and address those ethical concerns in their own projects. This lack of action and reliance on workarounds was explained through the perceived lack of control and distributed responsibility in the LLM supply chain, the conditional nature of engaging with ethics, and competing priorities. Finally, we reflect on the implications of our findings and present opportunities to shape emerging norms of engaging with large language models in HCI research.</p><h4 id="llmsense-harnessing-llms-for-high-level-reasoning-over-spatiotemporal-sensor-traces" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#llmsense-harnessing-llms-for-high-level-reasoning-over-spatiotemporal-sensor-traces"><span>LLMSense: Harnessing LLMs for High-level Reasoning Over Spatiotemporal Sensor Traces</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Xiaomin Ouyang, Mani Srivastava</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19857v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19857v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Most studies on machine learning in sensing systems focus on low-level perception tasks that process raw sensory data within a short time window. However, many practical applications, such as human routine modeling and occupancy tracking, require high-level reasoning abilities to comprehend concepts and make inferences based on long-term sensor traces. Existing machine learning-based approaches for handling such complex tasks struggle to generalize due to the limited training samples and the high dimensionality of sensor traces, necessitating the integration of human knowledge for designing first-principle models or logic reasoning methods. We pose a fundamental question: Can we harness the reasoning capabilities and world knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) to recognize complex events from long-term spatiotemporal sensor traces? To answer this question, we design an effective prompting framework for LLMs on high-level reasoning tasks, which can handle traces from the raw sensor data as well as the low-level perception results. We also design two strategies to enhance performance with long sensor traces, including summarization before reasoning and selective inclusion of historical traces. Our framework can be implemented in an edge-cloud setup, running small LLMs on the edge for data summarization and performing high-level reasoning on the cloud for privacy preservation. The results show that LLMSense can achieve over 80% accuracy on two high-level reasoning tasks such as dementia diagnosis with behavior traces and occupancy tracking with environmental sensor traces. This paper provides a few insights and guidelines for leveraging LLM for high-level reasoning on sensor traces and highlights several directions for future work.</p><h4 id="llms-as-academic-reading-companions-extending-hci-through-synthetic-personae" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#llms-as-academic-reading-companions-extending-hci-through-synthetic-personae"><span>LLMs as Academic Reading Companions: Extending HCI Through Synthetic Personae</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Celia Chen, Alex Leitch</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19506v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19506v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: This position paper argues that large language models (LLMs) constitute promising yet underutilized academic reading companions capable of enhancing learning.

However, we argue that a critical obstacle remains in deploying LLMs for practical use: the efficiency of LLMs when processing long textual user behaviors. As user sequences grow longer, the current efficiency of LLMs is inadequate for training on billions of users and items. To break through the efficiency barrier of LLMs, we propose Behavior Aggregated Hierarchical Encoding (BAHE) to enhance the efficiency of LLM-based CTR modeling. Specifically, BAHE proposes a novel hierarchical architecture that decouples the encoding of user behaviors from inter-behavior interactions. Firstly, to prevent computational redundancy from repeated encoding of identical user behaviors, BAHE employs the LLM&#39;s pre-trained shallow layers to extract embeddings of the most granular, atomic user behaviors from extensive user sequences and stores them in the offline database. Subsequently, the deeper, trainable layers of the LLM facilitate intricate inter-behavior interactions, thereby generating comprehensive user embeddings. This separation allows the learning of high-level user representations to be independent of low-level behavior encoding, significantly reducing computational complexity. Finally, these refined user embeddings, in conjunction with correspondingly processed item embeddings, are incorporated into the CTR model to compute the CTR scores. Extensive experimental results show that BAHE reduces training time and memory by five times for CTR models using LLMs, especially with longer user sequences. BAHE has been deployed in a real-world system, allowing for daily updates of 50 million CTR data on 8 A100 GPUs, making LLMs practical for industrial CTR prediction.</p><h4 id="tablellm-enabling-tabular-data-manipulation-by-llms-in-real-office-usage-scenarios" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#tablellm-enabling-tabular-data-manipulation-by-llms-in-real-office-usage-scenarios"><span>TableLLM: Enabling Tabular Data Manipulation by LLMs in Real Office Usage Scenarios</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Xiaokang Zhang, Jing Zhang, Zeyao Ma, Yang Li, Bohan Zhang, Guanlin Li, Zijun Yao, Kangli Xu, Jinchang Zhou, Daniel Zhang-Li, Jifan Yu, Shu Zhao, Juanzi Li, Jie Tang</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19318v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19318v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: We introduce TableLLM, a robust large language model (LLM) with 13 billion parameters, purpose-built for proficiently handling tabular data manipulation tasks, whether they are embedded within documents or spreadsheets, catering to real-world office scenarios.

To evaluate the ability of LLMs on code, both academic and industry practitioners rely on popular handcrafted benchmarks. However, prior benchmarks contain only a very limited set of problems, both in quantity and variety. Further, due to popularity and age, many benchmarks are prone to data leakage where example solutions can be readily found on the web and thus potentially in training data. Such limitations inevitably lead us to inquire: Is the leaderboard performance on existing benchmarks reliable and comprehensive enough to measure the program synthesis ability of LLMs? To address this, we introduce EvoEval -- a program synthesis benchmark suite created by evolving existing benchmarks into different targeted domains for a comprehensive evaluation of LLM coding abilities. Our study on 51 LLMs shows that compared to the high performance obtained on standard benchmarks like HumanEval, there is a significant drop in performance (on average 39.4%) when using EvoEval. Additionally, the decrease in performance can range from 19.6% to 47.7%, leading to drastic ranking changes amongst LLMs and showing potential overfitting of existing benchmarks. Furthermore, we showcase various insights, including the brittleness of instruction-following models when encountering rewording or subtle changes as well as the importance of learning problem composition and decomposition. EvoEval not only provides comprehensive benchmarks, but can be used to further evolve arbitrary problems to keep up with advances and the ever-changing landscape of LLMs for code.

However, in contrast to standard NLP tasks that inherently operate on human vocabulary, current research in generative recommendations struggles to effectively encode recommendation items within the text-to-text framework using concise yet meaningful ID representations. To better align LLMs with recommendation needs, we propose IDGen, representing each item as a unique, concise, semantically rich, platform-agnostic textual ID using human language tokens. This is achieved by training a textual ID generator alongside the LLM-based recommender, enabling seamless integration of personalized recommendations into natural language generation. Notably, as user history is expressed in natural language and decoupled from the original dataset, our approach suggests the potential for a foundational generative recommendation model. Experiments show that our framework consistently surpasses existing models in sequential recommendation under standard experimental setting. Then, we explore the possibility of training a foundation recommendation model with the proposed method on data collected from 19 different datasets and tested its recommendation performance on 6 unseen datasets across different platforms under a completely zero-shot setting. The results show that the zero-shot performance of the pre-trained foundation model is comparable to or even better than some traditional recommendation models based on supervised training, showing the potential of the IDGen paradigm serving as the foundation model for generative recommendation.

This paper proposes a multimodal interactive robot (PhysicsAssistant) built on YOLOv8 object detection, cameras, speech recognition, and chatbot using LLM to provide assistance to students&#39; physics labs. We conduct a user study on ten 8th-grade students to empirically evaluate the performance of PhysicsAssistant with a human expert. The Expert rates the assistants&#39; responses to student queries on a 0-4 scale based on Bloom&#39;s taxonomy to provide educational support. We have compared the performance of PhysicsAssistant (YOLOv8+GPT-3.5-turbo) with GPT-4 and found that the human expert rating of both systems for factual understanding is the same. However, the rating of GPT-4 for conceptual and procedural knowledge (3 and 3.2 vs 2.2 and 2.6, respectively) is significantly higher than PhysicsAssistant (p &lt; 0.05). However, the response time of GPT-4 is significantly higher than PhysicsAssistant (3.54 vs 1.64 sec, p &lt; 0.05). Hence, despite the relatively lower response quality of PhysicsAssistant than GPT-4, it has shown potential for being used as a real-time lab assistant to provide timely responses and can offload teachers&#39; labor to assist with repetitive tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to build such an interactive multimodal robotic assistant for K-12 science (physics) education.</p><h4 id="sdsat-accelerating-llm-inference-through-speculative-decoding-with-semantic-adaptive-tokens" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#sdsat-accelerating-llm-inference-through-speculative-decoding-with-semantic-adaptive-tokens"><span>SDSAT: Accelerating LLM Inference through Speculative Decoding with Semantic Adaptive Tokens</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Chengbo Liu, Yong Zhu</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18647v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18647v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: We propose an acceleration scheme for large language models (LLMs) through Speculative Decoding with Semantic Adaptive Tokens (SDSAT). The primary objective of this design is to enhance the LLM model&#39;s ability to generate draft tokens more accurately without compromising the model&#39;s accuracy. The core strategies involve: 1) Fine-tune the model by incorporating semantic adaptive tokens that possess flexible decoding capabilities without changing its structure, allowing them to generate high-quality draft tokens. 2) By employing a training method that does not affect the standard tokens, the model can acquire parallel decoding abilities atop its original framework with minimal training overhead. 3) We have designed the &quot;two-step-draft-then-verify&quot; generation strategies using both greedy search and nucleus sampling. Experiments conducted on the CodeLlama-13B and 7B models have yielded speed increases of over 3.5X and 3.0X, respectively.

Cryptographic algorithms exhibit greater logical complexity compared to typical code, yet their analysis is unavoidable in areas such as virus analysis and legacy code inspection. Existing methods often rely on data or structural pattern matching, leading to suboptimal generalizability and suffering from manual work. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called FoC to Figure out the Cryptographic functions in stripped binaries. In FoC, we first build a binary large language model (FoCBinLLM) to summarize the semantics of cryptographic functions in natural language. The prediction of FoC-BinLLM is insensitive to minor changes, such as vulnerability patches. To mitigate it, we further build a binary code similarity model (FoC-Sim) upon the FoC-BinLLM to create change-sensitive representations and use it to retrieve similar implementations of unknown cryptographic functions in a database. In addition, we construct a cryptographic binary dataset for evaluation and to facilitate further research in this domain. And an automated method is devised to create semantic labels for extensive binary functions. Evaluation results demonstrate that FoC-BinLLM outperforms ChatGPT by 14.61% on the ROUGE-L score. FoC-Sim outperforms the previous best methods with a 52% higher Recall@1. Furthermore, our method also shows practical ability in virus analysis and 1-day vulnerability detection.</p><h4 id="rejection-improves-reliability-training-llms-to-refuse-unknown-questions-using-rl-from-knowledge-feedback" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#rejection-improves-reliability-training-llms-to-refuse-unknown-questions-using-rl-from-knowledge-feedback"><span>Rejection Improves Reliability: Training LLMs to Refuse Unknown Questions Using RL from Knowledge Feedback</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Hongshen Xu, Zichen Zhu, Da Ma, Situo Zhang, Shuai Fan, Lu Chen, Kai Yu</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18349v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18349v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate erroneous outputs, known as hallucinations, due to their limitations in discerning questions beyond their knowledge scope. While addressing hallucination has been a focal point in research, previous efforts primarily concentrate on enhancing correctness without giving due consideration to the significance of rejection mechanisms. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive examination of the role of rejection, introducing the notion of model reliability along with corresponding metrics. These metrics measure the model&#39;s ability to provide accurate responses while adeptly rejecting questions exceeding its knowledge boundaries, thereby minimizing hallucinations. To improve the inherent reliability of LLMs, we present a novel alignment framework called Reinforcement Learning from Knowledge Feedback (RLKF). RLKF leverages knowledge feedback to dynamically determine the model&#39;s knowledge boundary and trains a reliable reward model to encourage the refusal of out-of-knowledge questions. Experimental results on mathematical questions affirm the substantial efficacy of RLKF in significantly enhancing LLM reliability.</p><h4 id="can-llms-converse-formally-automatically-assessing-llms-in-translating-and-interpreting-formal-specifications" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#can-llms-converse-formally-automatically-assessing-llms-in-translating-and-interpreting-formal-specifications"><span>Can LLMs Converse Formally?

Studies highlight the gap in the deceptive power of LLM-generated fake news with and without human assistance, yet the potential of prompting techniques has not been fully explored. Thus, this work aims to determine whether prompting strategies can effectively narrow this gap. Current LLM-based fake news attacks require human intervention for information gathering and often miss details and fail to maintain context consistency. Therefore, to better understand threat tactics, we propose a strong fake news attack method called conditional Variational-autoencoder-Like Prompt (VLPrompt). Unlike current methods, VLPrompt eliminates the need for additional data collection while maintaining contextual coherence and preserving the intricacies of the original text. To propel future research on detecting VLPrompt attacks, we created a new dataset named VLPrompt fake news (VLPFN) containing real and fake texts. Our experiments, including various detection methods and novel human study metrics, were conducted to assess their performance on our dataset, yielding numerous findings.</p><h4 id="llms-in-hci-data-work-bridging-the-gap-between-information-retrieval-and-responsible-research-practices" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#llms-in-hci-data-work-bridging-the-gap-between-information-retrieval-and-responsible-research-practices"><span>LLMs in HCI Data Work: Bridging the Gap Between Information Retrieval and Responsible Research Practices</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Neda Taghizadeh Serajeh, Iman Mohammadi, Vittorio Fuccella, Mattia De Rosa</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18173v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18173v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Efficient and accurate information extraction from scientific papers is significant in the rapidly developing human-computer interaction research in the literature review process.

However, they still make unjustified logical and computational errors in their reasoning steps and answers. In this paper, we leverage the fact that if the training corpus of LLMs contained sufficiently many examples of formal mathematics (e.g. in Isabelle, a formal theorem proving environment), they can be prompted to translate i.e. autoformalize informal mathematical statements into formal Isabelle code -- which can be verified automatically for internal consistency. This provides a mechanism to automatically reject solutions whose formalized versions are inconsistent within themselves or with the formalized problem statement. We evaluate our method on GSM8K, MATH and MultiArith datasets and demonstrate that our approach provides a consistently better heuristic than vanilla majority voting -- the previously best method to identify correct answers, by more than 12% on GSM8K. In our experiments it improves results consistently across all datasets and LLM model sizes.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in code generation and understanding but face difficulties in code change, particularly at the repository level. To overcome these challenges, we empirically study the reason why LLMs mostly fail to resolve GitHub issues and analyze some impact factors. Motivated by the empirical findings, we propose a novel LLM-based Multi-Agent framework for GitHub Issue reSolution, MAGIS, consisting of four kinds of agents customized for the software evolution: Manager, Repository Custodian, Developer, and Quality Assurance Engineer agents. This framework leverages the collaboration of various agents in the planning and coding process to unlock the potential of LLMs to resolve GitHub issues. In experiments, we employ the SWE-bench benchmark to compare MAGIS with popular LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Claude-2. MAGIS can resolve 13.94% GitHub issues, which significantly outperforms the baselines. Specifically, MAGIS achieves an eight-fold increase in resolved ratio over the direct application of GPT-4, the based LLM of our method. We also analyze the factors for improving GitHub issue resolution rates, such as line location, task allocation, etc.</p><h4 id="exploring-llms-as-a-source-of-targeted-synthetic-textual-data-to-minimize-high-confidence-misclassifications" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#exploring-llms-as-a-source-of-targeted-synthetic-textual-data-to-minimize-high-confidence-misclassifications"><span>Exploring LLMs as a Source of Targeted Synthetic Textual Data to Minimize High Confidence Misclassifications</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Philip Lippmann, Matthijs Spaan, Jie Yang</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17860v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17860v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Natural Language Processing (NLP) models optimized for predictive performance often make high confidence errors and suffer from vulnerability to adversarial and out-of-distribution data.

We conduct an extensive evaluation of our approach on three classification tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing the number of high confidence misclassifications present in the model, all while maintaining the same level of accuracy.

In conversion, a word with one part of speech is placed in a non-prototypical context, where it is coerced to behave as if it had a different part of speech. However, while this process affects a large part of the English lexicon, little work has been done to establish the degree to which language models capture this type of generalization. This paper reports the first study on the behavior of large language models with reference to conversion. We design a task for testing lexical-syntactic flexibility -- the degree to which models can generalize over words in a construction with a non-prototypical part of speech. This task is situated within a natural language inference paradigm. We test the abilities of five language models -- two proprietary models (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4), three open-source models (Mistral 7B, Falcon 40B, and Llama 2 70B). We find that GPT-4 performs best on the task, followed by GPT-3.5, but that the open source language models are also able to perform it and that the 7B parameter Mistral displays as little difference between its baseline performance on the natural language inference task and the non-prototypical syntactic category task, as the massive GPT-4.</p><h4 id="accelerating-radio-spectrum-regulation-workflows-with-large-language-models-llms" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#accelerating-radio-spectrum-regulation-workflows-with-large-language-models-llms"><span>Accelerating Radio Spectrum Regulation Workflows with Large Language Models (LLMs)</span></a></h4><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Amir Ghasemi, Paul Guinand</p><p><strong>Link</strong>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17819v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17819v1<span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span></a></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Wireless spectrum regulation is a complex and demanding process due to the rapid pace of technological progress, increasing demand for spectrum, and a multitude of stakeholders with potentially conflicting interests, alongside significant economic implications. To navigate this, regulators must engage effectively with all parties, keep pace with global technology trends, conduct technical evaluations, issue licenses in a timely manner, and comply with various legal and policy frameworks. In light of these challenges, this paper demonstrates example applications of Large Language Models (LLMs) to expedite spectrum regulatory processes. We explore various roles that LLMs can play in this context while identifying some of the challenges to address. The paper also offers practical case studies and insights, with appropriate experiments, highlighting the transformative potential of LLMs in spectrum management.</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div><footer class="vp-page-meta"><!----><div class="vp-meta-item git-info"><!----><!----></div></footer><!----><!--[--><!--[--><div class="my-footer">Copyright © 2024-present OpenDesign Community</div><!--]--><!--]--></main><!--]--></div><!--[--><!----><!--]--><!--]--></div>
