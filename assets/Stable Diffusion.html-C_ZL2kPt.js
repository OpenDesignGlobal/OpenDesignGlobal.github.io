In this paper, we tackle the challenge of open-set bias detection in text-to-image generative models presenting OpenBias, a new pipeline that identifies and quantifies the severity of biases agnostically, without access to any precompiled set.

Secondly, the target generative model produces images using the same set of captions. Lastly, a Vision Question Answering model recognizes the presence and extent of the previously proposed biases.

In this paper, we reveal that existing methods still face significant challenges in generating images that align with the image conditional controls. To this end, we propose ControlNet++, a novel approach that improves controllable generation by explicitly optimizing pixel-level cycle consistency between generated images and conditional controls. Specifically, for an input conditional control, we use a pre-trained discriminative reward model to extract the corresponding condition of the generated images, and then optimize the consistency loss between the input conditional control and extracted condition. A straightforward implementation would be generating images from random noises and then calculating the consistency loss, but such an approach requires storing gradients for multiple sampling timesteps, leading to considerable time and memory costs. To address this, we introduce an efficient reward strategy that deliberately disturbs the input images by adding noise, and then uses the single-step denoised images for reward fine-tuning. This avoids the extensive costs associated with image sampling, allowing for more efficient reward fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that ControlNet++ significantly improves controllability under various conditional controls.

Yet, little is understood about the fluid dynamics and impact of ACs residing in confined layered environments, like slicks floating on water bodies. In this study, we report novel solutions for the hydrodynamic fluctuations induced by ACs geometrically confined between a free surface and a fluid-fluid interface characterized by a jump in fluid viscosity. Combining theory and numerical experiments, we investigate the topology of the biogenic hydrodynamic fluctuations in a confined, thin fluid environment. We reveal that within this thin layer, ACs gives shape to three characteristic regions: Region I is the closest zone to the AC and the fluid-fluid interface, where hydrodynamic fluctuations are dominantly vertical; Region II is further up from the AC and is characterized by isotropic hydrodynamic fluctuations; Region III is the furthest region, near the free surface and is dominated by horizontal flow fluctuations. We demonstrate that the extent of these regions depends strongly on the degree of confinement, i.e. the layer thickness and the strength of the viscosity jump.

Throughout the training phase, ConsistencyDet initiates the diffusion sequence with noise-infused boxes derived from the ground-truth annotations and conditions the model to perform the denoising task. Subsequently, in the inference stage, the model employs a denoising sampling strategy that commences with bounding boxes randomly sampled from a normal distribution.

The HQDL is also a low-entropy and fragile liquid to exhibit, unlike conventional liquids, rather gas-like relaxation of velocity autocorrelation function, while there the atoms diffuse without noticeable contribution from quantum tunneling. The LQDL-HQDL transition is not a thermodynamic phase transition but a continuous crossover accompanied by the change of the expansion factor of quantum wavelength. Freezing of HQDL into the low quantum-dispersion amorphous solid occurs by heating from 0.2 to 0.3 K at 40-50 bar, while this $P$-$T$ condition coincides with the Kim-Chan normal-supersolid phase boundary of real $^4$He.

We use the diffusion probabilistic model in the coarse segmentation stage, with the obtained probability distribution serving as both the initial localization and prior cues for the level set method.

Two different wettabilities of the Ti64 surface are adjusted by using plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition. The dissolution process on the solid surface involves two distinct phases, namely bouncing of the oxygen bubble at the Ti64 surface and the subsequent dissolution of the bubble, primarily by diffusion. By investigating the features of oxygen bubbles bouncing, it was found that the boundary layer of dissolved oxygen surrounding the bubble surface is redistributed by the vortices emerging during bouncing. This establishes the initial conditions for the subsequent second dissolution phase of the oxygen bubbles on the Ti64 surfaces. In this phase, the mass transfer of O2 proceeds non-homogenously across the bubble surface, leading to an oxygen accumulation close to the Ti64 surface. We further show that the main factor influencing the differences in the dynamics of O2 bubble dissolution is the variation in the surface area of the bubbles available for mass transfer, which is determined by the substrate wettability.

We carry out 3D, local shearing box simulations that include all three low-ionization effects (Ohmic diffusion, ambipolar diffusion, and the Hall effect) to probe the nature of magnetically driven gas dynamics 1-30 AU from the central star. We find that gas turbulence can persist with a generous yet physically motivated ionization prescription (order unity Elsasser numbers). The gas velocity fluctuations range from 0.03-0.09 of the sound speed $c_s$ at the disk mid-plane to $\\sim c_s$ near the disk surface, and are dependent on the initial magnetic field strength. However, the turbulent velocities do not appear to be strongly dependent on the field polarity, and thus appear to be insensitive to the Hall effect. The mid-plane turbulence has the potential to drive dust grains to collision velocities exceeding their fragmentation limit, and likely reduces the efficacy of particle clumping in the mid-plane, though it remains to be seen if this level of turbulence persists in disks with lower ionization levels.")],-1),vi=e("h4",{id:"gooddrag-towards-good-practices-for-drag-editing-with-diffusion-models",tabindex:"-1"},[e("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#gooddrag-towards-good-practices-for-drag-editing-with-diffusion-models"},[e("span",null,"GoodDrag: Towards Good Practices for Drag Editing with Diffusion Models")])],-1),yi=e("p",null,[e("strong",null,"Authors"),t(": Zewei Zhang, Huan Liu, Jun Chen, Xiangyu Xu")],-1),wi=e("strong",null,"Link",-1),_i={href:"http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07206v1",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},xi=e("p",null,[e("strong",null,"Abstract"),t(": In this paper, we introduce GoodDrag, a novel approach to improve the stability and image quality of drag editing.

It explains advection-diffusion of heat including the heat exchange across the rock-ice avalanche body, basal heat conduction, production and loss of heat due to frictional shearing and changing temperature, a general formulation of the ice melting rate and enhancement of temperature due to basal entrainment. The temperature equation includes a composite term containing coupled dynamics: rate of change of thermal conductivity and temperature. Ice melt intensity determines these rates as mixture conductivity evolves, characterizing distinctive thermo-mechanical processes. The model highlights essential aspects of rock-ice avalanches. Lateral heat productions play an important role in temperature evolution. Fast moving avalanches produce higher amount of heat. Fast ice melting results in substantial change in temperature. We formally derive the melting efficiency dependent general fluid production rate.

Despite this progress, the cumbersome optimization process per se presents a critical hurdle to efficiency. In this paper, we introduce Hash3D, a universal acceleration for 3D generation without model training. Central to Hash3D is the insight that feature-map redundancy is prevalent in images rendered from camera positions and diffusion time-steps in close proximity. By effectively hashing and reusing these feature maps across neighboring timesteps and camera angles, Hash3D substantially prevents redundant calculations, thus accelerating the diffusion model's inference in 3D generation tasks. We achieve this through an adaptive grid-based hashing. Surprisingly, this feature-sharing mechanism not only speed up the generation but also enhances the smoothness and view consistency of the synthesized 3D objects. Our experiments covering 5 text-to-3D and 3 image-to-3D models, demonstrate Hash3D's versatility to speed up optimization, enhancing efficiency by 1.3 to 4 times. Additionally, Hash3D's integration with 3D Gaussian splatting largely speeds up 3D model creation, reducing text-to-3D processing to about 10 minutes and image-to-3D conversion to roughly 30 seconds.

Although PanoHead proves the possibilities of using a large-scale dataset with images of both frontal and back views for full-head synthesis, it often causes artifacts for back views. Based on our in-depth analysis, we found the reasons are mainly twofold. First, from network architecture perspective, we found each plane in the utilized tri-plane/tri-grid representation space tends to confuse the features from both sides, causing "mirroring" artifacts (e.g., the glasses appear in the back). Second, from data supervision aspect, we found that existing discriminator training in 3D GANs mainly focuses on the quality of the rendered image itself, and does not care much about its plausibility with the perspective from which it was rendered. This makes it possible to generate "face" in non-frontal views, due to its easiness to fool the discriminator. In response, we propose SphereHead, a novel tri-plane representation in the spherical coordinate system that fits the human head's geometric characteristics and efficiently mitigates many of the generated artifacts. We further introduce a view-image consistency loss for the discriminator to emphasize the correspondence of the camera parameters and the images.
