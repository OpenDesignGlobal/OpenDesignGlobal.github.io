The trained model takes the low-fidelity velocity field cost-effectively generated from the analytical engineering wake model as input and produces the high-fidelity velocity fields. The accuracy of the proposed ML model is demonstrated in a utility-scale wind farm for which datasets of wake flow fields were previously generated using LES under various wind speeds, wind directions, and yaw angles. Comparing the ML model results with those of LES, the ML model was shown to reduce the error in the prediction from 20% obtained from the GCH model to less than 5%. In addition, the ML model captured the non-symmetric wake deflection observed for opposing yaw angles for wake steering cases, demonstrating a greater accuracy than the GCH model.

While plain Transformers have been attempted for this task, they still fall short compared to the current leading methods, which are rooted in Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) due to the absence of structural priors. Recently, a novel selective state space model, Mamba, has surfaced as a compelling alternative to the attention mechanism in Transformers, offering efficient modeling of long sequences. In this work, to the utmost extent of our awareness, we present the first SAR framework incorporating Mamba. Each fundamental block of our model adopts a novel U-ShiftGCN architecture with Mamba as its core component. The encoder segment of the U-ShiftGCN is devised to extract spatial features from the skeletal data using downsampling vanilla Shift S-GCN blocks. These spatial features then undergo intermediate temporal modeling facilitated by the Mamba block before progressing to the encoder section, which comprises vanilla upsampling Shift S-GCN blocks. Additionally, a Shift T-GCN (ShiftTCN) temporal modeling unit is employed before the exit of each fundamental block to refine temporal representations. This particular integration of downsampling spatial, intermediate temporal, upsampling spatial, and ultimate temporal subunits yields promising results for skeleton action recognition. We dub the resulting model \\textbf{Simba}, which attains state-of-the-art performance across three well-known benchmark skeleton action recognition datasets: NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and Northwestern-UCLA.

In reality, human activities often involve temporal interactions, where links are impermanent, and understanding the evolution of cooperation on such ubiquitous temporal networks is an open question. Here, we present a general framework for systematically analyzing how collective cooperation evolves on any temporal network, which unifies the study of evolutionary game dynamics with dynamic and static interactions.

This contrasts drastically with the reality of food consumption, which features constantly changing data. Therefore, food image classification systems should adapt to and manage data that continuously evolves. This is where continual learning plays an important role. A challenge in continual learning is catastrophic forgetting, where ML models tend to discard old knowledge upon learning new information. While memory-replay algorithms have shown promise in mitigating this problem by storing old data as exemplars, they are hampered by the limited capacity of memory buffers, leading to an imbalance between new and previously learned data. To address this, our work explores the use of neural image compression to extend buffer size and enhance data diversity. We introduced the concept of continuously learning a neural compression model to adaptively improve the quality of compressed data and optimize the bitrates per pixel (bpp) to store more exemplars. Our extensive experiments, including evaluations on food-specific datasets including Food-101 and VFN-74, as well as the general dataset ImageNet-100, demonstrate improvements in classification accuracy.

We employ a three-layer model to illustrate the proposed AIGC-assisted SemCom (AIGC-SCM) architecture, emphasizing its clear deviation from existing SemCom. Grounded in this model, we investigate various AIGC technologies with the potential to augment SemCom's performance. In alignment with SemCom's goal of conveying semantic meanings, we also introduce the new evaluation methods for our AIGC-SCM system. Subsequently, we explore communication scenarios where our proposed AIGC-SCM can realize its potential. For practical implementation, we construct a detailed integration workflow and conduct a case study in a virtual reality image transmission scenario. The results demonstrate our ability to maintain a high degree of alignment between the reconstructed content and the original source information, while substantially minimizing the data volume required for transmission.

Acknowledging this limitation, our objective is to devise a framework capable of concurrently augmenting medical image and text data. We design a Pairwise Augmentation (PairAug) approach that contains an Inter-patient Augmentation (InterAug) branch and an Intra-patient Augmentation (IntraAug) branch. Specifically, the InterAug branch of our approach generates radiology images using synthesised yet plausible reports derived from a Large Language Model (LLM). The generated pairs can be considered a collection of new patient cases since they are artificially created and may not exist in the original dataset.

The consideration of model discrepancy is important because it can help avoid the "overfitting" problem in Bayesian calibration.

This necessity is pivotal in emerging domains like extended reality, robotics, and autonomous driving, which require the ability to respond to open-world stimuli. A key ingredient is the ability to identify objects based on free-form textual queries defined at inference time - a task known as open-vocabulary object detection. Multimodal backbones like CLIP are the main enabling technology for current open-world perception solutions. Despite performing well on generic queries, recent studies highlighted limitations on the fine-grained recognition capabilities in open-vocabulary settings - i.e., for distinguishing subtle object features like color, shape, and material. In this paper, we perform a detailed examination of these open-vocabulary object recognition limitations to find the root cause. We evaluate the performance of CLIP, the most commonly used vision-language backbone, against a fine-grained object-matching benchmark, revealing interesting analogies between the limitations of open-vocabulary object detectors and their backbones. Experiments suggest that the lack of fine-grained understanding is caused by the poor separability of object characteristics in the CLIP latent space. Therefore, we try to understand whether fine-grained knowledge is present in CLIP embeddings but not exploited at inference time due, for example, to the unsuitability of the cosine similarity matching function, which may discard important object characteristics. Our preliminary experiments show that simple CLIP latent-space re-projections help separate fine-grained concepts, paving the way towards the development of backbones inherently able to process fine-grained details.

In this paper, we fill this gap by conducting two user studies (n=470) to examine how human users perceive adversarial phishing webpages, spanning both synthetically crafted ones (which we create by evading a state-of-the-art ML-PWD) as well as real adversarial webpages (taken from the wild Web) that bypassed a production-grade ML-PWD.

However, not all adversarial perturbations are equally effective. For example, those with added typos are significantly more noticeable to users, who tend to overlook perturbations of higher visual magnitude (such as replacing the background).

Therefore, we propose a knowledge distillation method that addresses both the classification and regression tasks, incorporating a task significance strategy. By evaluating the importance of features based on the output of the detector's two sub-tasks, our approach ensures a balanced consideration of both classification and regression tasks in object detection.

However, the substantial size of these models, especially large models, poses a significant challenge when it comes to fine-tuning them for specific downstream tasks. As an alternative approach, retrieval-based methods have emerged as a promising solution, augmenting model predictions without the need for fine-tuning. Despite their potential, a significant challenge is that the designs of these methods often rely on heuristics, leaving critical questions about what information should be stored or retrieved and how to interpolate such information for augmenting predictions. To tackle this challenge, we first perform a theoretical analysis of the fine-tuning process, highlighting the importance of delta logits as a catalyst for improving model predictions. Building on this insight, we develop a novel retrieval-based method, FT2Ra, which aims to mimic genuine fine-tuning. While FT2Ra adopts a retrieval-based mechanism, it uniquely adopts a paradigm with a learning rate and multi-epoch retrievals, which is similar to fine-tuning.In token-level completion, which represents a relatively easier task, FT2Ra achieves a 4.29% improvement in accuracy compared to the best baseline method on UniXcoder. In the more challenging line-level completion task, we observe a substantial more than twice increase in Exact Match (EM) performance, indicating the significant advantages of our theoretical analysis.

However, the effectiveness of NACT varies significantly among patients, with a considerable subset displaying treatment resistance. Ineffective NACT not only leads to adverse effects but also misses the optimal therapeutic window, resulting in lower survival rate.

Specifically, iMD4GC incorporates unimodal attention layers for each modality to capture intra-modal information. Subsequently, the cross-modal interaction layers explore potential inter-modal interactions and capture complementary information across modalities, thereby enabling information compensation for missing modalities. To evaluate iMD4GC, we collected three multimodal datasets for GC study: GastricRes (698 cases) for response prediction, GastricSur (801 cases) for survival analysis, and TCGA-STAD (400 cases) for survival analysis.
