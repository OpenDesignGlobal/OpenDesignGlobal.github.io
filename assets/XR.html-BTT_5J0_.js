Despite this progress, current ODI rescaling methods predominantly focus on enhancing the quality of images in equirectangular projection (ERP) format, which overlooks the fact that the content viewed on head mounted displays (HMDs) is actually a rendered viewport instead of an ERP image. In this work, we emphasize that focusing solely on ERP quality results in inferior viewport visual experiences for users. Thus, we propose ResVR, which is the first comprehensive framework for the joint Rescaling and Viewport Rendering of ODIs. ResVR allows obtaining LR ERP images for transmission while rendering high-quality viewports for users to watch on HMDs. In our ResVR, a novel discrete pixel sampling strategy is developed to tackle the complex mapping between the viewport and ERP, enabling end-to-end training of ResVR pipeline. Furthermore, a spherical pixel shape representation technique is innovatively derived from spherical differentiation to significantly improve the visual quality of rendered viewports.

Most existing optimization efforts exclusively focus on the computation pipeline by optimizing the algorithm and/or designing dedicated accelerators while largely ignoring the front-end of any eye tracking pipeline: the image sensor. This paper makes a case for co-designing the imaging system with the computing system. In particular, we propose the notion of "in-sensor sparse sampling", whereby the pixels are drastically downsampled (by 20x) within the sensor. Such in-sensor sampling enhances the overall tracking efficiency by significantly reducing 1) the power consumption of the sensor readout chain and sensor-host communication interfaces, two major power contributors, and 2) the work done on the host, which receives and operates on far fewer pixels. With careful reuse of existing pixel circuitry, our proposed BLISSCAM requires little hardware augmentation to support the in-sensor operations.

A significant research branch in this domain focuses on user behavior modeling. Current research predominantly centers on modeling co-occurrence relationships between the target item and items previously interacted with by users in their historical data. However, this focus neglects the intricate modeling of user behavior patterns. In reality, the abundance of user interaction records encompasses diverse behavior patterns, indicative of a spectrum of habitual paradigms. These patterns harbor substantial potential to significantly enhance CTR prediction performance. To harness the informational potential within user behavior patterns, we extend Target Attention (TA) to Target Pattern Attention (TPA) to model pattern-level dependencies. Furthermore, three critical challenges demand attention: the inclusion of unrelated items within behavior patterns, data sparsity in behavior patterns, and computational complexity arising from numerous patterns. To address these challenges, we introduce the Deep Pattern Network (DPN), designed to comprehensively leverage information from user behavior patterns.

However, in many cases, individuals may not want to remove all degradations, for instance, a blurry lens revealing a beautiful snowy landscape (double degradations). In such scenarios, people may only desire to deblur. These situations and requirements shed light on a new challenge in image restoration, where a model must perceive and remove specific degradation types specified by human commands in images with multiple degradations. We term this task Referring Flexible Image Restoration (RFIR). To address this, we first construct a large-scale synthetic dataset called RFIR, comprising 153,423 samples with the degraded image, text prompt for specific degradation removal and restored image. RFIR consists of five basic degradation types: blur, rain, haze, low light and snow while six main sub-categories are included for varying degrees of degradation removal.

TransRFIR is based on two devised attention modules, Multi-Head Agent Self-Attention (MHASA) and Multi-Head Agent Cross Attention (MHACA), where MHASA and MHACA introduce the agent token and reach the linear complexity, achieving lower computation cost than vanilla self-attention and cross-attention and obtaining competitive performances.

Hence, there is a need to assess the impact of such filters on the performance of existing face recognition systems. The limitation associated with existing solutions is that these solutions focus more on the beautification filters. However, the current AR-based filters and filters which distort facial key points are in vogue recently and make the faces highly unrecognizable even to the naked eye. Also, the filters considered are mostly obsolete with limited variations. To mitigate these limitations, we aim to perform a holistic impact analysis of the latest filters and propose an user recognition model with the filtered images.

Our approach utilizes the generative power of a 2D diffusion model and prompt self-refinement to create a high-quality and globally coherent panoramic image. This image acts as a preliminary "flat" (2D) scene representation. Subsequently, it is lifted into 3D Gaussians, employing splatting techniques to enable real-time exploration. To produce consistent 3D geometry, our pipeline constructs a spatially coherent structure by aligning the 2D monocular depth into a globally optimized point cloud. This point cloud serves as the initial state for the centroids of 3D Gaussians. In order to address invisible issues inherent in single-view inputs, we impose semantic and geometric constraints on both synthesized and input camera views as regularizations. These guide the optimization of Gaussians, aiding in the reconstruction of unseen regions.

High resolution LiDAR on the other hand, can be expensive and lead to interference problems in heavy traffic given their active transmissions.

Such disadvantages can be tackled via Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC), consisting in deploying computation capability in network nodes deployed close to the devices (vehicles in this case), such as to satisfy the stringent CAV requirements.

Conventionally, these methods have been validated by switching between physical rooms.

In contrast to the prevailing deep learning methods, as a core contribution, this thesis aims to develop algorithms that follow first principles, where sophisticated physic-based models are introduced alongside with simpler learning and inference tasks. The outcomes of these algorithms yield processes that can consume much larger volume of data for highly accurate reconstructing 3D scenes at a scale without losing methodological generality, which are not possible by contemporary complex-model based deep learning methods. Specifically, the dissertation introduces three novel methodologies that address the challenges of inferring appearance and geometry through physics-based modeling.

This paper proposes Mixed reality-based robot navigation interface using an optical-see-through MR-beacon (MRNaB), a novel approach that incorporates an MR-beacon, situated atop the real-world environment, to function as a signal transmitter for robot navigation. This MR-beacon is designed to be persistent, eliminating the need for repeated navigation inputs for the same location. Our system is mainly constructed into four primary functions: "Add", "Move", "Delete", and "Select". These allow for the addition of a MR-beacon, location movement, its deletion, and the selection of MR-beacon for navigation purposes, respectively. The effectiveness of the proposed method was then validated through experiments by comparing it with the traditional 2D system. As the result, MRNaB was proven to increase the performance of the user when doing navigation to a certain place subjectively and objectively.

However, hallucination is a significant concern. In response, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a highly promising paradigm to improve LLM outputs by grounding them in factual information. RAG relies on textual entailment (TE) or similar methods to check if the text produced by LLMs is supported or contradicted, compared to retrieved documents. This paper argues that conventional TE methods are inadequate for spotting hallucinations in content generated by LLMs. For instance, consider a prompt about the 'USA's stance on the Ukraine war''. The AI-generated text states, ...U.S. President Barack Obama says the U.S. will not put troops in Ukraine...'' However, during the war the U.S. president is Joe Biden which contradicts factual reality. Moreover, current TE systems are unable to accurately annotate the given text and identify the exact portion that is contradicted. To address this, we introduces a new type of TE called ``Factual Entailment (FE).'', aims to detect factual inaccuracies in content generated by LLMs while also highlighting the specific text segment that contradicts reality. We present FACTOID (FACTual enTAILment for hallucInation Detection), a benchmark dataset for FE. We propose a multi-task learning (MTL) framework for FE, incorporating state-of-the-art (SoTA) long text embeddings such as e5-mistral-7b-instruct, along with GPT-3, SpanBERT, and RoFormer. The proposed MTL architecture for FE achieves an avg. 40% improvement in accuracy on the FACTOID benchmark compared to SoTA TE methods.
